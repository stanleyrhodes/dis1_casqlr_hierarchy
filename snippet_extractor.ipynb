    "Background: I have about 1.49 GB of JSON files, 50-80 KB each. They're JSON because I followed an example to output data from Zotero, and it used JSON. I realize that JSON is a serialization format, meaning I should be storing it, and reading and writing to it, in a different format; JSON is meant for communicating the data, not that sort of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the large file size, I've used ijson to read the data incrementally and get what I need written to an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "My issue is, now that I have the data, how should I store it for reading and writing, and how should I read and write to it?\n",
    "\n",
    "How big would it be? I need to see how big the review array is. It's actually pretty small. 200 KB. All 28 files together would be about 5.7 MBs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so how should I read and write to it? I guess the first thing to try would be a pandas table. Yep, easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do I store it on disk? The suggestion seems to be pickle.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I pickle the df, how big is it? 132 KB. Even smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "df.to_pickle(\"my_data.pkl\")\n",
    "df = pd.read_pickle(\"my_data.pkl\")\n",
    "\n",
    "So I can just process each JSON, edit as a df, save as a pickle regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I could also append just the coding changes to a temp file. I could do this for each \"row\" operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, to summarize the design:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the CLI UX:\n",
    "The user specifies the JSON file to use after launching the app.\n",
    "The user can specify to use the last file.\n",
    "The user is looking at a blank definitional snippet.\n",
    "The user needs to be able to go forward or back snippets.\n",
    "    - JKL: keys and left-right arrow keys, larrow back and rarrow forward\n",
    "The user needs to be able to code the currently displayed snippet with multiple codes (prob letters).\n",
    "    - QWERTY keys fastest? WASD, Z, R, E, Q\n",
    "The user needs to be able to blank the codes for the current displayed snippet.\n",
    "    - Key in QWERTY maybe\n",
    "The user needs to be able to go to the next blank entry\n",
    "    - Down arrow key?\n",
    "\n",
    "On the \"backend\" the app is:\n",
    "1. Knows if there is a pickle file for the filename the user selects.\n",
    "    - If so, dataframe is loaded from the pickle.\n",
    "    - If not, creates a pickle file for that filename.\n",
    "2. Knows the filename the user selected, and displays it. \n",
    "3. Knows the current key (df row number) of the snippet, which is just row number, and is unique for the file open.\n",
    "4. Knows the item_key, which is not unique for the entry, but allows us to identify the exact bib item. (A bib item may have multiple definitional snippets.)\n",
    "5. Knows the updates made to the data.\n",
    "6. Writes each update made to the data, with a timestamp, to a history file (history.txt). \n",
    "    - filename, row number, item_key, search phrase, code\n",
    "7. Writes each update made to the data to the dataframe.\n",
    "8. Pickles the dataframe to file each time the user moves from one snippet to another, IF something has changed.\n",
    "9. Knows the number of blank codings, which the CLI displays to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outline the functions necessary.\n",
    "Write the logic for all the manipulations, but don't require key presses.\n",
    "Each of these functions will be triggered by a key press.\n",
    "\n",
    "On launch,\n",
    "App checks to see if the directory it's in has any JSON files that match \"####_zot2json.json\".\n",
