To answer this question, extant literature proposes two competing views. One view builds on social exchange theory to argue that organizational members try to exchange status recognition for advice. The other view claims that the motivation to release information and exchange knowledge is triggered by the relational dimensions of trust, norms, and obligations. To advance our understanding of the motivations behind advice relations we propose a unified view of social exchange theory. We test the hypothesis that advice seeking and giving are shaped differently by the presence of the formal organizational structure, which embeds advice relations in hierarchical orderings of various strength. Empirical analysis of advice seeking ties among the around 200 members of a multiunit organization provides support to the coexistence between the two perspectives postulated. Results indicate that advice relations between members of the same organizational subunits are shaped by hierarchical ordering. Advice is likely to be exchanged with status recognition, either socially or formally defined, and advice seeking relations are likely to be non mutual. When linking organizational members formally connected across subunits boundaries, advice relations are shaped by interpersonal trust. Advice is likely to be exchanged with advice, and advice seeking relations are likely to be mutual.","2016-01","2022-10-03 04:22:10","2022-10-03 04:22:10","2022-10-03 04:22:10","15846","","1","2016","","Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.aom.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Academy of Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An Investigation of the Student Role Identity Standard at the Intersection of Student and Teacher Perspectives","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1561556720/abstract/12713CC517F44249PQ/1","Over the past decade, engaging student voice has emerged as an approach to increasing meaningful student involvement in schools towards meeting adolescents' developmental needs for agency, efficacy, and sense of belonging. Central to student voice work is the re-creation of student-teacher and student-organization relationships, generating student identity roles that are fundamentally different from the roles traditionally allocated to students. Conventional concepts of student roles by both adults and youth can act as barriers to increasing student voice. The goal of this study was to develop a better understanding of student role identity. Applying a critical ethnography approach in the context of participatory action research, a situated description of the student role within the organizational context of a rural high school was developed from the perspectives of students and teachers through the use of an online software platform. Keeping with student voice values and participatory action research protocols, students took a central role in developing and piloting survey questions, interpreting and organizing responses, reviewing the results, and presenting them to the school community. The data revealed both the aspirations and limitations of the student and teacher conceptions of the student role. Conventional notions of student identity dominated the role descriptions, and were generally consistent across student and teacher responses. Significant areas of divergence between student and teacher constructs included the explicit temporal orientation toward the future exclusive to the student responses, the engagement in academics that dominated the teacher submissions and rankings, and the conception of the student as a citizen/community member that was found only in the teacher responses. The results suggested an inclination on the part of both students and teachers to increase opportunities for students to inform and influence policies and practices at all levels of the school organization. Presentations of the study results to the school community by the student researchers have induced some systemic reform toward promoting student voice.","","2022-10-03 04:23:34","2022-10-03 04:23:34","2022-10-03 04:23:34","","242","","","","","How Do Youth and Adults at a Rural High School Conceptualize the Role of Student?","","","","","Portland State University","United States -- Oregon","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781321061642","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology; Education; Rural education; Student engagement; Student role; Student voice; Student-teacher relationships","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowledge management is marked by a clear departure from traditional management  thinking that viewed the ideal organisation as a bureaucracy with a clear hierarchical  structure. Much of this has been the natural result of advances in information  technology making new ways of working possible, but frequently, flatter structures are  advocated on the assumption that knowledge work is necessarily stifled in hierarchical  structures.  The thesis sets out to show that whilst this assumption might be true, it can also be  ideological if based on a naive conception of hierarchy and organisation. This is done by  describing various notions of hierarchy that go beyond the pure bureaucratic form.  Thereafter it is demonstrated that these more nuanced notions of hierarchy lie at the core  of some of the foundational knowledge management theories.  The first chapter gives an overview of management thinking; connecting and  contrasting scientific management with knowledge management. The case is made for  why many assume that knowledge management is inherently anti-hierarchical.  The second chapter describes the various notions of hierarchy by tracing the historical  origins of the word and exploring how it has found multiple meanings in the context of  society and organisations. Four prominent usage contexts of the notion of hierarchy  emerge. The first usage is that of control where hierarchy refers to bureaucracies. The  second usage examines the use of hierarchy in identifying various organisational  cultures (Markets, Clans, Adhocracies and Hierarchies). The third usage applies to  organisation sensemaking levels. The fourth usage refers to the use of hierarchy as it  applies to organisations as the coupling of systems and subsystems.  In the third chapter it is demonstrated to what extent each of these notions of hierarchy  informs selected mainstream knowledge management theories. It is argued that there are  multiple contexts in which the notion of hierarchy can be used and observed in  knowledge management thinking.  The fourth chapter concludes by restating the multiple meanings of organisational hierarchy and discussing the implications for knowledge management. The thesis comes  to the conclusion that the notion of hierarchy is readily acknowledged and used in  knowledge management thinking, albeit in different contexts and in more nuanced ways  than merely as control. What is needed is to take these various contexts into account  before a claim can be made that hierarchy is bad or good for knowledge management. A  better conceptualisation of what is meant by hierarchy shows that such blanket claims  are neither accurate nor instructive.","2014-04","2022-10-03 04:25:28","2022-10-03 04:25:28","2022-10-03 04:25:28","","","","","","","Control, value, sense and system","","","","","Stellenbosch : Stellenbosch University","","en_ZA","Stellenbosch University","Thesis","","","scholar.sun.ac.za","","Accepted: 2014-04-16T17:28:19Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"PT3G8SBC","thesis","2009","Zhang, Feng","Chinese primacy in East Asian history: Deconstructing the tribute system in China's early Ming Dynasty.","","","","","https://etheses.lse.ac.uk/2737/","The ""tribute system"" has been the central organizing concept for our thinking about historical East Asian politics since the 1940s. Despite its dominance in the literature, however, the concept remains ill-defined and underspecified. The extant frameworks constructed around the concept also have not been evaluated conceptually and empirically in a systematic way. Most importantly, the tribute system, as an important institution for interstate relations in East Asian history, remains undertheorized in the existing literature. This thesis identifies three interrelated ways in which the ""tribute system"" concept has been used in the literature and argues that they all encounter problems in interpreting or explaining historical East Asian politics. The thesis deconstructs this concept by developing a theory of Chinese primacy in historical East Asia and by evaluating it against evidence from early Ming China's (1368-1424) relations with Korea, Japan, and the Mongols. The theory and evidence show that East Asian politics under the condition of Chinese primacy or unipolarity are best described as the dynamics between China's political/military domination and other states' accommodation and resistance. A variety of motives and strategies that China and its neighbours can employ toward each other are identified. The multiplicity of the relations between China and its neighbours suggests the need to deconstruct the analytical category of the ""tribute system"" and develop new conceptualizations about historical East Asian politics. The thesis calls for new thinking about historical East Asian politics, contributes to theorizing in this field by developing a synthetic theory of Chinese primacy that draws on both realist and constructivist theories of International Relations, and evaluates some persistent myths about Chinese foreign policy and East Asian politics in history.","2009","2022-10-03 04:25:36","2022-10-03 04:25:36","2022-10-03 04:25:36","","","","","","","Chinese primacy in East Asian history","","","","","London School of Economics and Political Science","","en","","phd","","","etheses.lse.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"V43JFHYS","journalArticle","2018","Zhang, Jianhua","Intercity relationships within urban agglomeration and their impacts on urban economic development in the case of GuangdongHong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, China","","","","","https://thesis.eur.nl/pub/46511/","Urban agglomerations are the results of flows of production factors and industrial division of labour among cities within a specific geographic area. In the context of economic globalization and regional integration, urban agglomerations have become important spatial units that represent a country’s participation in international competition and complementarity. The development of urban agglomerations should be conducive to the optimal allocation of resources within the region. However, cities mostly ignore the interests of the other cities to attract capital, business, talent and investment, thus promoting their own economic development. This often leads to regional problems such as industry contradiction, function duplication, and uneven development levels among cities. Therefore, how to understand cities’ positions within urban agglomeration, and how to promote economic development through complementarity-ness is a significant or worthwhile research subject. This study uses 11 cities from Guangdong-Hong Kong-Greater Bay Area, one of the most developed urban agglomerations in China, to explore above questions. These 11 cities show a clear hierarchy in terms of political positions, economic development levels, comparative advantages and industrial characteristics. Since 1980s, based on their own comparative advantages, a strong network of competition and complementarity has formed among these cities. However, several factors have also led to fierce disorderly competition and unscientific complementary behaviors among these cities. First, due to the fact that Hong Kong, Macau, and PRD’s mainland cities enjoy three different administrative, currency and economic systems, the complementary obstacles between these three regions always exist. Second, due to the lack of scientific regional development guidance, cities tend to develop similar highvalued industries, even in the case they do not have the comparative advantages. This leads to geographic and functional niche overlaps among cities. In this context, research set out to find out how cities within GBA can develop their economies by dealing well with the competition and complementary relationships with each other. Starting from analyzing the overall characteristics of intercity relationships, this thesis analyzed the economic spatial distribution of GBA, urban economic network among cities, and the industrial division of labour. After the description of the overall characteristics of intercity relationships, in the second section, intercity relationships were defined as three types: competition, complementary, and non-relation. Based on results of D-S model, each two cities were evaluated as one of the three intercity relationships in terms of three sectors of industries, either competition, complementary, or non-relation. Finally, intercity competition and complementary relationships were considered as one of the factors influencing urban economic development to analyze the impacts of intercity relationships on urban economy. In terms of policy recommendations, it is important to design a regional management mechanism that considers the integrity of GBA. Also, it is crucial to establish a benefit sharing and compensation mechanism, as well as a cooperative incentive system for the better development of the less developed regions. What is more, multiple parties should be encouraged to participate in urban complementarity relationships. It not only provides opportunities for small private enterprises, it also stimulates the motivation of multiparticipators to participate in cross-regional cooperation.","2018-09-03","2022-10-03 04:25:40","2022-10-03 04:25:40","2022-10-03 04:25:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","thesis.eur.nl","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike teams with clearly defined work roles and team structures that were introduced to increase work efficiency and minimize redundancy, the team we studied lacks the role differentiation. To better understand how complex work is accomplished under these conditions, we conducted in-situ observations in the center's control room and interviewed communication specialists. We found that communication specialists self-organized by using a mix of material and immaterial coordination mechanisms, including work schedules, computer systems, and tacit agreements to coordinate tasks. Using these findings, we then identified three features of self-organized, collocated and time-critical teamwork that require technology support: awareness of task ownership, task self-assignment, and informal team hierarchy. We conclude by discussing technology requirements to support these teamwork features.","2018-11-01","2022-10-03 04:25:44","2022-10-03 04:25:44","2022-10-03 04:25:44","199:1–199:21","","CSCW","2","","Proc.

The research question that this study sets out to answers is: How is hierarchy established by four preschool children during free play through the use of preference? The main theory of importance is the New Sociology of Childhood whose key argument is that children are a part of the social culture they jointly construct by playing together. Conversation Analysis was used to analyze the material by mapping out the uses of preference. This study is thus an explorative and qualitative sociolinguistic study. The material was collected through videotaping four children in a preschool setting and the chosen sequences represent a heavy use of preference and a focus on disputes and conflict. The results showed that the children used dispreferred answers to reject and challenge their peers in order to reject and deny their rights e.g. ownership or decide the rules of the game. Dispreferred answers were also used to signal alignment to one or more of their peers by rejecting someone else, thus empowering one member and rejecting another. Preferred answers were mainly used to signal alignment, or to accept a suggestion which in turn affected the hierarchical structure through the distribution of support.","2015-10-03","2022-10-03 04:25:48","2022-10-03 04:25:48","2022-10-03 04:25:48","","","","","","","How is hierarchy established in peer interaction?","","","","","","","eng","","","","","gupea.ub.gu.se","","Accepted: 2015-10-03T04:16:16Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data are drawn from a study of 2824, 15-year-olds in 22 Scottish secondary schools in 2006 who provided information on family SES (parental occupation, material deprivation and family affluence) and social position in school hierarchies, together with two morning salivary cortisol samples. School social position was assessed by participants placing themselves on seven ‘ladders’, from which three factors were derived, termed scholastic, peer and sports hierarchies. Controlling for confounds, there was little or no variation in cortisol by any SES measure. By contrast, each school hierarchy was independently associated with cortisol, but in different ways. For the scholastic hierarchy, an inverse linear relationship was found for females, cortisol increasing with lower position. For peer hierarchy, an opposite (direct) linear relationship occurred for males, while for females elevated cortisol was associated only with ‘top’ position. For sports, elevated cortisol among males was associated with ‘bottom’ position, among females with all except the ‘top’. These results are interpreted in the context of Sapolsky's (Sapolsky, 2005) predictions for stress responses to hierarchical position in stable and unstable social systems, the former represented by the scholastic hierarchy involving elevated cortisol in lower positions, the latter by peer hierarchy with elevated cortisol in higher positions. Overall, the results highlight the greater importance of school-based peer groups than family SES for young people's psychoneuroendocrine response.","2010-04-01","2022-10-03 04:26:08","2022-10-03 04:26:08","2022-10-03 04:26:08","1246-1253","","8","70","","Social Science & Medicine","The relative importance of family socioeconomic status and school-based peer hierarchies for morning cortisol in youth","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Stress; Cortisol; Health inequalities; Psychoneuroendocrine response; School peer group; Scotland; Social hierarchies; Socioeconomic status (SES); UK; Youth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we give first indications on how different the body and embodied knowledge respond to different ways of management and how this might affect the adaptability of groups and organizations. In an MBA-course on adaptive organizations we applied movement improvisation to let students experience the difference between formal and informal group coordination. We let students compare their experiences and substantiated their reflection by a video comparison of studentsâ movements. As a result, we found that the mutual body awareness and connectedness increased after a movement improvisation exercise, stimulating informal-emergent coordination. The embodied knowledge was enriched and evoked to support emergent coordination amongst the students compared to a disconnectedness amongst students in a formal-directive way of coordination.","2016","2022-10-03 04:26:10","2022-10-03 04:26:10","2022-10-03 04:26:10","47-63","","1","5","","","How To Access Organizational Informality","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c)","","","","oa.journals.publicknowledgeproject.org","","Number: 1","","","","","applied improvisation; connection; embodied knowledge; FT MBA teaching; movement improvisation; Organizational informality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"3J68GXMJ","book","2010","Whang, Eunyoung","Profitability Ratio Analysis for Professional Service Firms","","","","","","The DuPont analysis is one of the most commonly used financial analysis tools for traditional businesses. It disaggregates return on equity (ROE) into profit margin (PM), asset turnover (ATO), and leverage (LEV) thereby providing value-relevant information relative to aggregated profitability. In this paper, I extend the use of the DuPont model to the professional service industry. The professional service industry has recently become one of the fastest growing segments driving the U.S. economy (USITC 2009, U.S. Census Bureau of Economic Analysis 2009). Unlike traditional businesses whose key business assets are their physical assets, professional service firms rely on human capital assets that are not recognized in the balance sheet. I introduce a profitability ratio analysis model that focuses on human capital. I validate the model by examining whether the disaggregated profitability ratios for professional service firms add relevant information over aggregated ratio in the same way as they do for traditional businesses. I use law firms as a representative segment of the professional service sector to empirically evaluate my model. I collect financial and human resource data for 81 of the 100 largest U.S. law firms from 2000 to 2007 then disaggregate profit per equity partner (PPP) into the three profitability ratios: profit margin (PM), revenue per lawyer (RPL), and leverage (LEV). I compare the absolute forecasting error (AFE) of the simple AR (1) model that uses only the current year profit per equity partner (PPP) to forecast one-year ahead profit per equity partner (PPP) and my model that uses the three profitability ratio model (PM, RPL, and LEV) of current year to forecast one-year ahead profit per equity partner (PPP). I find that using the disaggregated profitability ratios significantly improves forecasting of future profitability relative to using only profit per equity partner (PPP), analogous to similar results documented for the DuPont model in Fairfield and Yohn (2001) and Soliman (2004). I examine which firm characteristics are associated with the profitability ratios. I include four firm characteristics variables (STRUCTURE, SCOPE-INTL, SCOPE-RGNL, and SCALE) that are commonly used in economic analysis of industrial organizations. I find that the profitability ratios are systematically associated with firm characteristics that reveal information on the business models of individual firms. Leverage (LEV) is higher in law firms with non-equity partners (STRUCTURE), international focus (SCOPE-INTL), regional focus (SCOPE-RGNL), or large size (SCALE). Law firms that are large sized (SCALE) or regional focused (SCOPE-RGNL) command premium fee (high RPL) on average, but law firms with international focus or with non-equity partners do not.","2010","2022-10-03 04:26:11","2022-10-03 04:26:11","","","110","","","","","","","","","","Temple University Libraries","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: IxL2zQEACAAJ","","","https://www.google.com/books?id=IxL2zQEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I ask: What impacts the legacies of political motherhood movements in terms of duration, visibility and remembrance? By duration, I mean the length of time an organization remains active. Visibility refers to how “seen” a civic group is. Remembrance implies whether an organization’s work is remembered or forgotten. I argue that it is the perceptions of other social movement organizations (especially of feminist and human rights organizations) that contribute to either upward or downward spirals of duration, visibility and remembrance that in turn impact the legacies of political motherhood movements. When social movement actors perceive the duration, visibility and remembrance of a political motherhood movement positively, this upward spiral promotes the legacy of that movement. Conversely, when perceptions of duration, visibility and remembrance are viewed negatively, this downward spiral deadens the legacy of that political motherhood movement. This study compares Argentina’s Madres of the Plaza de Mayo (Madres) and Sri Lanka’s Mothers’ Front using visual analysis, feminist re-reading and counterfactuals. The Madres have been active for four decades, are visible domestically and internationally and widely remembered. Conversely, the Mothers’ Front organized for roughly seven years. While at one time highly visible domestically, the group was never “seen” internationally. Today the Mothers’ Front has been overlooked in terms of popular culture and memorialization, apparently forgotten even domestically. This project concludes that the legacies of political motherhood movements for peace and/or justice are impacted by the perceptions of other social movement actors, which in turn color understandings of women’s political participation and their struggles for peace and/or justice. Legacy-making holds critical implications for understanding women’s political participation for we cannot explore what is forgotten. In such an exploration, however, we can find that political motherhood struggles for peace and/or justice reveal that the problem is not with the use of political motherhood as a strategy but rather in the political limitations movements face in challenging state and non-state violence. Moreover, we can also find how nonfeminist political motherhood struggles can morph into more maternal feminist ones with more expansive and transnationally connected agendas for peace and justice. Thus, such movements deserve political and feminist attention for what they can tell us about the barriers to and prospects for cultivating women’s political movements for peace and justice, including the majority of those that have been initially motivated by motherhood, now and in the future.","","2022-10-03 04:26:13","2022-10-03 04:26:13","2022-10-03 04:26:13","","593","","","","","Nurturing Democracy in Armed Conflicts Through Political Motherhood","","","","","University of Cincinnati","United States -- Ohio","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798691218545","","","","","Gender; Global South; Security; Motherhood movement; Peace; Transitional justice; Womens peace activism; Womens political participation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, it uses a symbolic interactionist approach to define and explain the nature of ethnic identity. This approach argues that ethnic identification is a reflexive incorporation of the shared understandings (acquired through social interaction) of what it means to be a member of a given ethnic group. Second, this study tests a measurement technique in which ethnic identity is measured in terms of the shared meanings associated with ethnicity. This is done through the use of a semantic differential format and a discriminant analysis statistical technique. Finally, this study investigates ethnic identity's impact on academic performance. Although previous findings on the ethnic identity/academic performance relationship are mixed, theoretically, the meanings attributed to ethnic identity are irrelevant to the meanings of academic performance. Therefore, it is hypothesized that ethnic identity would have little or no impact on academic performance. Based on data collected from a survey of white (N = 139) and black (N = 73) college students at Indiana University, Bloomington, a measure of ethnic identity was assessed. In testing the ethnic identity/academic performance hypothesis, a multiple regression statistical analysis revealed that ethnic identity has no direct impact on academic performance. Also an examination of the process predicting academic performance was shown to be significantly different for white and black students but in neither case was the effect of ethnic identity on academic performance present. Conclusions support the use of symbolic interactionism and the measurement technique in future research of ethnic identity. It is suggested that future research needs to examine the indirect impacts of ethnic identity on academic performance as well as its impact on other social behavior. Also further attention should be given to examining changes in ethnic identity.","","2022-10-03 04:26:16","2022-10-03 04:26:16","2022-10-03 04:26:16","","159","","","","","Ethnic Role/Identity","","","","","Indiana University","United States -- Indiana","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798403451499","","","","","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, I examine Australian Blackness as an identity that is cultivated through media interaction and discursive norms. As the terms “white (fellas)” and “Black (fellas)” are largely employed through in-group vernacular exchanges, I interviewed 27 Aboriginal Australian people about the personal significance of Blackness for them. Pulling from methods of narrative analyses and interethnic discourse, I ask the following questions: In what ways do Aboriginal people as a minority deploy and make meaning of Black identity through discourse and media consumption? How does their talk about Blackness frame its political and cultural significance, particularly in relation to Black people in the United States? I examine Black Pacific identity outside of (and in relation to) the Black Atlantic and the African diaspora.Please see the accompanying video at https://vimeo.com/356457346","2021-09-27","2022-10-03 04:26:17","2022-10-03 04:26:17","2022-10-03 04:26:17","24","","0","15","","","Oceanic Negroes","","","","","","","en","The  International Journal of Communication  is an academic journal.

"B35DZTS6","thesis","","White, Richard Downing","Ethics and hierarchy: The influence of a rigidly hierarchical organizational design on moral reasoning","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304368754/abstract/E56F9B0B57C84986PQ/1","Contemporary organizational theory consistently argues that organization structure can affect the behavior of members of the organization. Research suggests that members of organizations structured in a rigid hierarchy exhibit lower morale, decreased innovation, and lower output when compared to organizations structured less rigidly. While the research is clear on the impact of hierarchical design on overall behavior, it is less clear on the effect that rigid hierarchy may have on ethical behavior. This study investigates the hypothesis that rigid organizational hierarchy inhibits ethical behavior. Ethical behavior is operationalized by applying Kohlberg's model of six moral development stages, and measured by Rest's Defining Issues Test (DIT). The hypothesis is tested by comparing the mean DIT scores of 480 Coast Guard personnel with the means of meta-samples of individuals from less rigid organizations. A military organization, the Coast Guard is a stereotypical rigid hierarchy, with a tall pyramid structure, numerous hierarchical levels, centralized decision making, and an emphasis on obedience and heteronomous behavior. The hypothesis is tested further by comparing DIT scores of Coastguardsmen assigned to large ships with Coastguardsmen assigned to shore units. Because of the extremely regimented routine aboard ships, sailors are allowed little opportunity to act autonomously. It is hypothesized that the DIT scores of seagoing Coastguardsmen will be lower than their counterparts assigned to less rigidly structured shore units. The findings support the hypothesis that a rigid hierarchy restricts moral development. Coast Guard respondents score about seven points lower on the DIT than a large adult meta-sample from society-at-large. Sea-based Coastguardsmen score significantly lower than their shore-based counterparts, suggesting that the extremely rigid hierarchy of the shipboard environment further restricts moral development. This study suggests an ethical dimension be added to the negative consequences of rigid hierarchy. It also argues that the military, from a moral development perspective, is different from mainstream society, and that the difference is caused primarily by the rigid hierarchy employed by the military. The findings reinforce the need for democratic, civilian supervision of military policy and provide a recommended strategy for accommodating the tensions between rigid hierarchy and moral development.","","2022-10-03 04:26:19","2022-10-03 04:26:19","2022-10-03 04:26:19","","226","","","","","Ethics and hierarchy","","","","","The Pennsylvania State University","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780591689419","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some relationships are characterized by dominance and subordination, while others are highly egalitarian. Why relationships vary along this continuum has never been studied quantitatively in the International Relations literature. In this thesis I set out to test the most popular and well-developed theory on this subject, namely the transaction-cost theory of international security relationships. Using a range of variables and datasets from the quantitative International Relations literature, I have developed a research design to test the empirical implications of the transaction-cost theory on the subject of the design of military alliances. Some alliances are designed with hierarchical safeguards that allow a powerful state to restrict the autonomy of a weaker ally, and the transaction-cost theory should be able to account for these alliances. Using a logistic regression model, I have investigated the effects of transaction-cost variables on the choices of alliance design. I find that most of the hypotheses that are derived from the transaction-cost theory are discarded. Meanwhile, a model that includes successful transaction-cost variables offers significant explanatory and predictive power, and is a substantial improvement on a baseline model of variables derived from more mainstream International Relations theory. My analysis provides new and valuable knowledge about which factors are decisive in pushing the governance of security relationships in a hierarchical direction. It seems that powerful states` fears of being pulled into unwanted conflicts, institutional dissimilarity, previous colonial relationships, and asymmetries in size and material power go a long way in explaining why some states end up in hierarchically organized military alliances.","2011","2022-10-03 04:27:28","2022-10-03 04:27:28","2022-10-03 04:27:28","","","","","","","The Correlates of Subordination","","","","","","","eng","","Master thesis","","","www.duo.uio.no","","Accepted: 2013-03-12T09:23:57Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The culture and language of Japan seem to embody the aspects of this theory as social relation is portrayed frequently, if not constantly, through the use of language. Academics such as Shibatani (1990), Wetzel (1988) and Hasegawa (1998; 2005) have conducted research on how the presence of in- and out-groups affect the use of language in Japan. If a group is considered to be intimate or distant to the speaker, language that addresses that intimacy or distance is applied. This concept, known as Uchi and Soto, is widely considered to be central to the Japanese language and encompasses numerous aspects of that language. However, due to the general nature of the concept, there is little acknowledgement of to what extent the Japanese population shares this notion of how groups are perceived, which is what this thesis aims to explore. Two core aspects of how group relations are expressed in Japanese will be focused on in this thesis: The levels of politeness and the verbs of giving and receiving. Using polite language towards a person indicates a social difference between speaker and addressee, making it highly likely that the two do not belong to the same obvious social group while using casual language between people indicates the opposite. Japanese shows a stark difference in language between the various levels of politeness that can be expressed. In the case of giving and receiving, the aspect of a fluid notion of self can lead to the speaker describing another person receiving a gift as if the speaker had received it as well. While these verbs have guidelines as to how one accurately describe one group giving to or receiving from another group, if one defines groups differently to the other, differences in language should also appear. As such, it’s in this thesis’ interest to investigate if group-relations in a given social situation are perceived similarly in Japan which will be done through reviewing previous research regarding Uchi and Soto as well as own studies.","2015","2022-10-03 04:27:32","2022-10-03 04:27:32","2022-10-03 04:27:32","","","","","","","The Ins and Outs of Japanese","","","","","","","eng","info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","","","","lup.lub.lu.se","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is intended to support my thesis that music-making can be usefully characterised as intersubjective practice, whereby musicians and participants acquire and reaffirm a sense of social and communal identity through involvement and interaction within the symbolic world of the music event.  My objective is to contribute towards popular music scholarship by focusing on music-making at a grass-roots level and showing the value of analysing this seemingly peripheral domain in enhancing our understanding of popular music culture. By using Christopher Small’s (1998a, 1998b) concept of ‘musicking’ as a central reference point, my analysis is based on a methodological framework of symbolic interactionism, drawing on the works of Harold Garfinkel (1967) and Erving Goffman (1959, 1961b, 1963), to map out a series of object-signs as constituent elements of the intersubjective domain of the folk club. By applying this approach to case study analyses, interview responses and direct observation, this study reveals the internal relations and dynamics of signification and identification that gave shape to amateur musicmaking as discourse. This is complemented by recognition of external discursive frameworks – professionalism, popularism, regulation and the institutionalised English ‘folk scene’ – and their role in defining the cultural experience of sharing music in folk clubs. In this way, my thesis demonstrates the capacity of object-sign analysis to provide a more rigorous characterisation of amateur music discourse than one based solely on ethnographic description and interpretation.  The outcome of this research is a detailed perspective of ‘musicking’ as an experiential and cultural activity. It shows how amateur musicians and participants become subsumed within the discursive domain of folk clubs through sharing and recognising meanings invoked in musical (and social) performance. I conclude that the benefits of ‘musicking’ as a concept have not been sufficiently realised in popular music studies and that my research opens up possibilities for new and significant insights through its focus on intersubjective engagement with music as a focus for cultural practice and identity.","2013-07-04","2022-10-03 04:27:33","2022-10-03 04:27:33","2022-10-03 04:27:33","","268","","","","","","","","","","Birmingham City University","","en","","doctoral","","","www.open-access.bcu.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building on earlier cultural pragmatic work that is both derivative of, and informed by Dell Hymes' (“Models”) assumptive base in thinking about communication as systematic, social, and culturally distinct, this study examines the Finnish term asia [matter-of-fact] as a cultural term for talk. This study asks: how do participants conceive and identify through the asia term, and enact their world of communication? Through applying the terms for talk framework (Carbaugh, “Fifty”) this study is organized generally to explore reports and enactments of communication practice in some Finnish adult education scenes. This is done through an examination of nonverbal acts, norms, ritual, and a vacillating form. This study proceeds to examine “listenership” in which a set of nonverbal acts such as keeping the face straight, minimal gestures, and maintaining a diverted or shifted gaze are acts deemed proper conduct to the asia [matter-at-hand]. Speech deemed to be of the asia style must be direct, factual, goal-directed, controlled and unemotional, and not be “personal face” but “informational face.” Asia talk as a sequence of acts and its ritualized event structure show infocentrism to be the sacred principle celebrated in asia talk. Central findings of this dissertation point to infocentrism as a Finnish culturally based (a) relational code with a preference for an informational face, (b) idea of clearness where persons are motivated to understand, (c) an aesthetic of simplicity in expression describing the necessary degree of performability in speech. Two models for identifying are found in a vacillating form, one infocentric, and the other personalistic. The principle finding shows how asia, as a Finnish cultural term for talk, constructs a sense of infocentric communication, sociality, and personhood that, in some educational scenes, places informational concerns over, and against, personalistic and expressive concerns. Through a comparative examination of other cultures we see how cultural terms for talk enter as resources for understanding cultural variability in communication conduct. This study further points to how educators and students can be prepared for studies abroad or teaching in multicultural contexts.","","2022-10-03 04:27:39","2022-10-03 04:27:39","2022-10-03 04:27:39","","241","","","","","""Asia"" [matter-of-fact] communication","","","","","University of Massachusetts Amherst","United States -- Massachusetts","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780599329294","","","","","Communication; Language; Education; Asia; Communication and the arts; Cultural terms; Educational scenes; Finnish; literature and linguistics; Matter-of-fact communication; Talk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"Q7YRTJH5","thesis","","Wilkinson, Dennis M.","Community structure and dynamics in social systems","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/305438757/abstract/120F65038F0F4D17PQ/1","This thesis presents applications of statistical physics to the study of the structure and dynamics of social systems, that is, systems whose interactions are based on information exchange. Social systems typically possess a community structure arising from the self organization of groups of interacting components into tightly-knit clusters. An automated method of identifying communities within a network of interactions is first presented. The method includes a statistical component crucial to obtaining accurate results in large, complex systems. It is applied to two real-world social networks, a network of email interactions and a network of related articles in the biomedical literature. The clusters it identifies within these networks are shown to correspond to communities of interrelated components. Next, the dynamics of cooperative problem solving processes on social systems are studied. A simple stochastic model is proposed which captures key aspects of the dynamics which have been empirically observed. Most important among these are the increase in average time to solution and in likelihood of long delays as the system size increases, as well as the log-normal distribution of times to solution. It is shown that a community structure both reduces the average time to solution and decreases the probability of delay. In cases where a system of cooperative efforts does not possess an inherent community structure, the effect of imposing communities is examined. The factor which most affects the dynamics when communities are imposed is shown to be the degree to which individuals neglect information from outside their own communities. The theory of stochastic vector processes is central to the dynamics of social systems and a mathematical study of this subject is presented. Expressions describing the evolution of the moments in the neighborhood of fixed points are obtained for arbitrary systems. Approximation techniques are applied in the small and large noise limits, while an exact result is found for the second moment given a certain form of noise. The dependence of the moments on parameters such as system size and magnitude of noise is then examined. A critical value for the noise variance is found and used to determine a stability phase diagram for vector stochastic processes. Analytical results are validated by numerical simulation.","","2022-10-03 04:27:40","2022-10-03 04:27:40","2022-10-03 04:27:40","","176","","","","","","","","","","Stanford University","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780496135035","","","","","Networks; Social systems; Community structure; Moment instabilities; Pure sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By forcing residents to choose sides and regulating their access to commodities such as salt and tea, local committees made government integral to how people lived their lives. Rebel campaigns against the British army in 1776 and 1777 furthered this involvement, giving state-formed commissions for detecting and defeating conspiracies the warrant to investigate individual conduct and define acceptable political behavior. With Tories expelled from central New York and the disaffected persuaded to support rebellion in the war's later years, the rebel government redistributed loyalist property and enfranchised much of white society. By the 1788 Poughkeepsie Convention, New Yorkers - a people who had previously related to each other through their social class, religious affiliation, and position within a community - believed that government existed to expand political participation, provide citizens with economic opportunity, and protect the rights of the individual.","2013","2022-10-03 04:27:49","2022-10-03 04:27:49","2022-10-03 04:27:49","","","","","","","New York transformed","","","","","University of Alabama Libraries","","en_US","All rights reserved by the author unless otherwise indicated.","thesis","","","ir.ua.edu","","Accepted: 2017-03-01T16:46:56Z Artwork Medium: electronic Interview Medium: electronic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A mechanism specifies a distribution of sanctions in case of failure across the levels of the hierarchy. It is said to be investment-inducing if it induces all agents to invest in equilibrium. It is said to be optimal if it does so at minimal total punishment. We characterize optimal investment-inducing mechanisms in several versions of our benchmark model. In particular we refer to the problem of allocating individuals with diverse qualifications to different levels of the hierarchy as well as allocating tasks of different importance across different hierarchy levels.

Little is known about Chia Tao except that he was one of a circle of literary figures patronized by Han Yu; his poetry is said to be ""lean"" and ""strange."" The aid of this dissertation is to use Chia Tao's poetry as a starting point for the investigation of the poetry of his circle. By arriving at a more realistic and informed appraisal of Chia Tao's poetry, one can re-examine the works of other members of this circle and define the parameters of their shared aesthetic. If Han Yu's fu-ku (restoration of antiquity) ideals were formative in this aesthetic, understanding of the notion of fu-ku must be broadened to include the assumption that artistic creation is in itself a worthy act, and that the dedicated artist is moral by definition. Contents. Chapter one is an inquiry into the major unresolved questions surrounding Chia Tao's life, the composition of his alleged poetic circle and his relationships with individuals in that group. It also discusses the conventions of his biographical portrayal and the significance thereof. Chapter two examines the themes and techniques in his self-consciously archaic poems; his self-constitution as an adherent of fu-ku ideals and the relationship of this to his conventional portrayal. In Chapter three I discuss the affective qualities in Chia Tao's poetry as shown by his relationship to significant non-human phenomena in his landscapes. I also explore the effect of Chia Tao's poetic persona; tensions between the desire for intimacy and the desire for separation. Chapter four analyses Chia Tao's presentation of the world--how his conflicting desires are expressed by his manipulation of time and space, and the kinetic quality of his poetry. Chapter five contains a tentative identification of Chia Tao as an adherent of Ch'an Buddhism. It also discusses reflections of the Buddhist outlook in his poetry and the way in which he individualizes it. Chapter six discusses recurrent preoccupations and techniques in Chia Tao's poetry. It contains a comparison of his works with those by other members of his circle in an attempt to answer the questions: Was his poetry strange or revolutionary? What does it have in common with the poetry of his associates? The Conclusion contains a summary of critical opinion concerning Chia Tao, and looks at his works in the light of redefined fu-ku ideals.","","2022-10-03 04:31:47","2022-10-03 04:31:47","2022-10-03 04:31:47","","380","","","","","The Poetry of Chia Tao (779-843)","","","","","Stanford University","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798662086982","","","","","Language; literature and linguistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through the use of phenomenological methods a purposeful sample of six full time African American administrators from various units across Broussard University’s campus were selected and interviewed extensively.  The study revealed invariant themes that emerged from analysis of interview transcripts to explain the phenomenon of minority experiences and persistence in a predominantly White institution. More specifically, the study addresses the strategies used by African American administrators to persist in their leadership capacity as members of an underrepresented group.  By exploring the particular experiences of African American administrators, this study also sought to develop and test a theoretical model for minority persistence strategies within majority homogenous institutional structures.   	The conceptual framework that guided this inquiry focused on variables that influence the persistence strategies used by minority leaders.  Specifically the study explores the experiences of African American administrators working at a predominantly White institution as suggested from a review of literature.  Those variables were identified from within four areas in the education literature: (a) social dominance theory, (b) organizational socialization, (c) the role of critical race theory and whiteness as property, and (d) the role of race, culture, identity, and gender on career dynamics.","2010-10-27","2022-10-03 04:44:20","2022-10-03 04:44:20","2022-10-03 04:44:20","","","","","","","When Being Black Isn’t Enough","","","","","","","en","EMBARGO_NOT_AUBURN","","","","etd.auburn.edu","","Accepted: 2010-10-27T17:58:36Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike earlier approaches to the subject, which tended to focus upon unitary processes of ‘politicization’, the new social history of politics has developed a broader sense of the political, centred upon power relations, agency and resistance.1 Most notably, this new social history of politics has questioned the validity of older approaches to the political, which tended to present early modern society as an organic hierarchy defined by popular deference and the uncritical acceptance of authority. Thus, Mark Kishlansky’s assumption that ‘in early modern England, political activity took place within the context of a hierarchical social structure and theocentric universe’, and that ‘social relations’ were conducted within ‘complex notions of honour, standing, and deference . . . [which] helped to regulate and absorb conflict between and within loosely defined status groups’ has in recent years been questioned. Whereas Kishlansky believed that early modern society was defined by ‘symbiotic relationships’, the new social historians of politics have emphasized the fluidity of power relations, the contingent nature of deference and the contested relationship between governor and governed.2","2006-11-01","2022-10-03 04:44:30","2022-10-03 04:44:30","2022-10-03 04:44:30","41-72","","1","193","","Past & Present","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, it addresses how responding to cultural differences portrayed in multicultural literature can serve to challenge adolescents’ allegiances to status quo discourses and cultural models, and how teachers not only can rouse students to clarify and change their value stances related to race, class, and gender, but also provide support for and validation of students’ self-interrogation. Highlighting the influence of sociocultural forces, the book contributes to understanding the role of institutions in shaping adolescents’ lives, and identifies needs that must be addressed to improve those institutions. Current theory and research on critical discourse analysis, cultural models theory, and identity construction is meshed with specific applications of that theory and research to case-study profiles and analysis of classroom discussions.

However, the current international division of labor and its corresponding constraints on policy autonomy mark a major departure from the global conditions of the post-war period.

Furthermore, there are two preconditions for implementing these functions: the capability of the state to control over cross-border capital flows, and to maintain neutrality in arbitrating between the competing claims of labor and capital. However, both of these conditions are unfeasible under neoliberal globalization for two reasons - (i) the deep engagement of national economies in global value chains (GVCs), and (ii) the structurally imbalanced bargaining power between capital and labor. The former has increased national economic stakes in facilitating non-interference in global capital flows, while the latter imbues the state with a policy bias favoring capital’s interest over labor’s. Therefore, attempt at levering the state to restore post-war embedded liberalism is constrained by this collusion of capital and power in hyper-globalization.","2020-09-01","2022-10-03 04:45:08","2022-10-03 04:45:08","2022-10-03 04:45:08","","","","","","","Populism and Hyper-globalisation","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","Populism; Capital-Labor Conflict; Deep Engagement; Embedded Liberalism; GVCs; Neoliberal Globalization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3722949","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various methods to demarcate a water resource management unit have been suggested, including watershed, river basin, and problem-shed approaches. Management based on these boundaries requires better inter jurisdictional coordination among decision-makers within the specified basin. Issues arising from conventional jurisdiction-based or sector-based water resource management are apparent, and inter-jurisdictional coordination has posed tremendous challenges for the implementation of basin-wide management schemes. Three governance structures are evaluated with respect to water resource management—Market, Hierarchy, and Communal. Their mechanisms, effectiveness, and efficiency in achieving coordination among decision-makers are revealed. Comparative analysis is made using transaction cost theory. The Lake Biwa-Yodo River basin and the Potomac River basin case studies are discussed as examples of formal and informal institutions, and the transactions they managed, which gave rise to immediate and long-term results. In particular, the studies show drought management and water allocation are best managed under governance structures that recognize the public good (or social welfare) aspects of water resource management. Under hierarchical structures a central entity exists and intervenes under extenuating circumstances, for the benefit of all stakeholders. Under communal structures, high goal congruence lends itself to the benefit of participants. In terms of transaction cost analysis, a market structure requires extensive efforts to arrive at well-defined, transferable water rights. It requires significant time and planning for water rights to be secured, transferable rights and to ensure drought management and fair allocation function at the same time. Communal and hierarchical approaches are flexible to change, regard water resources as public goods, and are able to implement long-lasting results. Through these governance structures, policies, practices, and beliefs about water resource management may co-mingle, and evolve into basin-wide institutions.","","2022-10-03 04:45:14","2022-10-03 04:45:14","2022-10-03 04:45:14","","157","","","","","The governance of water","","","","","The Johns Hopkins University","United States -- Maryland","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493607726","","","","","Social sciences; Governance; Transaction costs; Institutional; River basin; Water resource management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The chapter of literature review firstly explored the past researches on Japanese beauty norms in the scope of race and gender studies. In addition, different types of beauty concepts including those which are peculiar to Japanese beauty cultures, were also introduced before this study moved to the research of the present beauty ideals. This research was done by studying in total eight still advertising images published in 2017, selected from four different Japanese cosmetics brands, for which the methodological approaches of semiotics and encoding/decoding were applied. Based on the data analysis and interpretation of signs representing beauty ideals in these advertisements, this study has discovered certain distinguishing characteristics of each branding tactic to offer definitions of beauty. The findings indicated that the process of representing Japanese beauty ideals through the act of cosmetics advertising are consequently intertwined with race and gender discourses.","2020","2022-10-03 04:45:16","2022-10-03 04:45:16","2022-10-03 04:45:16","","","","","","","What Is Beautiful?","","","","","","","en","This publication is copyrighted.

Al comienzo de esta primera égloga, Encina se presenta disfrazado de cómico pastor para entregar un poema largo a la Duquesa. Usa la figura del rústico pastor para subrayar su propia inferioridad y dependencia social y para lisonjear a sus nobles mecenas. A través de esta misma figura Encina opone nociones de valor basado en la nobleza o la pureza de sangre con la idea senequista del mérito personal, exigiendo que se le reconozca como igual con la libertad de controlar su propio destino. La primera égloga capta la tensión que existe entre el nuevo individualismo del ambiente urbano en que se crió Encina y su posición en la corte de Alba, donde se encuentra en el ambiente sofocante de la sociedad señorial. El esfuerzo de Encina por igualarse con el Duque, inscrito contradictoriamente dentro del marco de las relaciones de dependencia características del mecenazgo, se trasluce en las imágenes de la obra, que establecen paralelos entre el Duque y Encina, cuya productividad artística se describe con las mismas imágenes utilizadas anteriormente en el retrato del Duque.","1986","2022-10-03 04:45:21","2022-10-03 04:45:21","2022-10-03 04:45:21","145-160","","1","11","","","The New Man and the Shepherd","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Revista Canadiense de Estudios Hispánicos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we review various individual-based models of collective behaviour and discuss their merits and drawbacks. We further analyse some one-dimensional models in the context of locust swarming. In specific models, in both one and two dimensions, we demonstrate how varying parameters relating to how much attention individuals pay to their neighbours can dramatically change the behaviour of the group. We also introduce leader individuals to these models. Leader individuals have the ability to guide the swarm to a greater or lesser degree as we vary the parameters of the model. Finally, we consider evolutionary scenarios for models with leaders in which individuals are allowed to evolve the degree of influence neighbouring individuals have on their subsequent motion.","2010","2022-10-03 04:45:30","2022-10-03 04:45:30","2022-10-03 04:45:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ora.ox.ac.uk","","Publisher: Canadian Applied and Industrial Maths Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How do actors negotiate the constitutive norms of liberal global governance at the juncture of the domestic and the international? This project provides an answer to these questions by developing a performative account of norm socialization and uses this theoretical framework to analyze Islamist negotiations of secularism and democracy in Turkey and Egypt. I suggest that the International Relations scholarship often takes socialization as a pedagogic process in which the non-West is made to transition into the norms of liberal modernity in a hierarchical relationship of authority. In this perspective, actors either socialize into liberal norms or resist them. After identifying the shortcomings of these narratives, I develop a reading that takes socialization as a performative process of cultural translation and norm appropriation. By so doing, I analyze the ways in which norms can be adopted non-normatively--at once inhabited and resisted. I argue that a performative reading enables a more complex understanding of the dynamics of normalization and resistance in socialization. Then I employ this framework to analyze Turkish AK Party's and Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood's negotiation of secularism and democracy by drawing mainly on the data I collected in my fieldwork research in Turkey and Egypt. More specifically, I examine the performative politics of translation and appropriation in the AK Party's notions of `democratic secularism' and `conservative democracy' and the Muslim Brotherhood's notions of `civil state within an Islamic framework' and `Islamic democracy.'","2014-08","2022-10-03 04:45:32","2022-10-03 04:45:32","2022-10-03 04:45:32","","","","","","","Performative socialization in world politics","","","","","","","en","","","","","conservancy.umn.edu","","Accepted: 2014-11-12T16:30:39Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After the topics were identified by the citation-topic model, we first built a 2-mode co-occurrence (the keywords and topic co-occurrence) network to track the dynamics of topic trends. Then we built a single-mode network to illustrate the evolution path and content changes of research topics, and within which each node represented a topic and each edge indicated the relationship between topics. The index to measure topic association strength defined in this paper reflects both similarity and dissimilarity between topics, which helps us to better obtain the evolution trend, the main evolution path and the content change of topics. In addition, the analysis framework used in this study can reveal more micro topic evolution details. The experimental results show that this analysis framework can be used to track the evolution of research topics at a micro level and the social network analysis method used in this paper can help to grasp the topic evolution path and content changes. However, the analysis framework will produce limited results when conducting unstructured data other than the bibliographic data. In addition, the effectiveness of the framework introduced in this paper needs to be verified in more research fields. Surely, this analysis framework introduced in this paper can help scholars and researchers map the evolution process of research topics and grasp the content changes in a field's research topics over time.","2015-08","2022-10-03 04:45:36","2022-10-03 04:45:36","","2648-2653","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","","","Analytical models; Agriculture; Market research; carbon fiber; citation-topic model(CTM); Continuous wavelet transforms; Indexes; Integrated circuits; social network analysis(SNA); Social network services; topic evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Proud of their newly won independence, many former colonials aspired to the standards of Great Britain. Inhabiting the margins of the transatlantic world, they were self-conscious about the fact that some Europeans considered their nation inferior due to its lack of cultural refinement. Hierarchies based upon levels of civility often revolved around the possession and production of refined objects. This dissertation analyzes the lingering effects of the colonial past on the formation of American national identity by paying close attention to the social significance of material culture. A widespread sense of the inequity between Britain and the United States was embodied in the exchange of refined and unrefined objects. In general, Americans traded raw materials of nature for “cooked” objects manufactured in Britain. Participants in the transatlantic networks of merchants, intellectuals, missionaries and naturalists who were involved in the movement of objects were particularly cognizant of the difference in status and power between the United States and the former mother country. They remained dependent upon their British counterparts and worked to maintain connections established during the colonial period. This reliance was a practical necessity and a vehicle for Americans to establish their independent national presence on the world stage. Yet Americans knew their relationships with British counterparts were not yet equal. While recognizing the integral ways that the United States is different from twentieth century post-colonial societies who emerged from European imperial rule, there are some generative connections to be made such as the effect of continuing inequality and dependence between nations legally defined as separate and equal. This dissertation follows lines of inquiry about the early national period that foreground the importance of continuities with the past during this transitional and uncertain age. Instead of viewing this era as the beginning of the nation, this study considers it as the fruition of a waning world. Seen in this way, the cultural politics of the young American nation are a post-colonial politics.","","2022-10-03 04:45:53","2022-10-03 04:45:53","2022-10-03 04:45:53","","438","","","","","Post-colonial America","","","","","University of California, Los Angeles","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493858401","","","","","Social sciences; Early national period; Exchange networks; Nationalism; Transatlantic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why would states that had just broken free of a regional hegemon willingly enter an international organization dominated by that hegemon? Furthermore, why would the larger and more powerful country establish an organization where it would need to play the leading and, especially, most expensive role? For some time, Western scholars have asked these questions about Western organizations, populated mostly by democratic states and often created in opposition to the Soviet bloc; but this dissertation explores them in the context of authoritarian regimes born of a non-Western empire in an era when several observers thought Cold War logic might no longer be relevant. This study thus examines the factors which affect regional cooperation in the post-Soviet space. It focuses on the CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organization), an organization that began in 1992 as the CST (Collective Security Treaty) and evolved into the CSTO in 2002, and whose membership has varied over time, allowing scholars to explain the causes of these changes over time. The two most prominent members of the CSTO are Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, whose behaviors toward the organization have varied despite the apparent similarities of these two countries. By explaining the behaviors of Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan toward the CSTO, this dissertation helps understanding of the intervening behaviors of such authoritarian states after the Cold War.","2018","2022-10-03 04:45:59","2022-10-03 04:45:59","2022-10-03 04:45:59","","213","","","","","","","","","","Kent State University","United States -- Ohio","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798496559737","","","","","Cooperation; Post-Soviet space; Sovereign state","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current research identifies through hierarchical cluster analysis that the  myriad of riding feeds offered on the South African market fall into only four simple categories on  the basis of wet chemistry. Feeds were subjected to the in vitro gas production technique (IVGPT)  described by Pell and Schofield (1993), using equine faecal inoculum. Gas profiles, corrected for  control fermentation profiles in the absence of substrate, were fitted to the model described by  Campos et al. (2004) to derive GP kinetics. Gas production kinetics, and information in respect of  pH, degradation efficiency, lag time and apparent and true digestibilities were obtained. The feeds  were tested for glycaemic response in miniature horses using the hexokinase method with  deproteinization using an auto analyser (Roche Diagnostics). Blood glucose parameters of feeds  (mean, peak, slope and time to peak and area under the curve) in each group were compared by  analysis of variance and regression with covariates. In vivo analysis of rates of passage and  digestibility using using post-prandial percentages of acid insoluble marker collection was used to  study the gastrointestinal process, to indicate foregut and hindgut compartmental flow. The need  to balance nitrogen levels with a proportional supply of fermentable carbohydrate contradicts  widely used protein intakes in the horse. In vitro fermentation was used in an analysis of nutrient  synchrony, to identify optimal fermentative capacity for utilization of horse feeds. The  characteristics of horse feeds were related to requirement and were composited in an analysis of  the representation of horse feeds that would best reflect optimal utilization in the horse, to produce  a method of feed characterisation that would lead to the optimal prediction of response of horses to  feeds offered to South African horses.","2011","2022-10-03 04:46:03","2022-10-03 04:46:03","2022-10-03 04:46:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_ZA","","Thesis","","","researchspace.ukzn.ac.za","","Accepted: 2013-01-16T10:09:09Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A subsystemic analysis of regional interactions among the 'stans'","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1504278406/abstract/E3F7A7E3E2714511PQ/1","My dissertation assesses the extent to which post-Soviet Central Asia is emerging as an interactive regional subsystem focused more on problems and actors within the region than on those outside the region. The answer to this question has important implications for policy, because in the presence of a strong subsystem the important sources of change in the region cannot be exclusively domestic in nature, as changes in one part of the subsystem can become the catalyst of change in other parts of the region. It also means that if a regional identity is stronger than national identities, then presumably there are no exclusively national solutions to regional problems. Whether Central Asia is evolving into a regional subsystem or not is an empirical question which I examine by utilizing three types of interaction data: intergovernmental visits, trade transactions, and water events data. These data provide a reliable proxy for testing the extent to which a subsystemic pattern is developing. They also help identify a nuanced view of interstate interactions both in terms of regularity (i.e. who interacts with whom) and intensity (i.e. how often states interact with each other). The focus of concern is limited to the fifteen years following independence from the Soviet Union. I analyze the results of the interaction data in terms of three structural models (full-fledged interactive subsystem, fragmented subsystem and Russo-centric subsystem) to assess the degree of fit for each.","","2022-10-03 04:46:06","2022-10-03 04:46:06","2022-10-03 04:46:06","","214","","","","","Is there a Central Asia?","","","","","Indiana University","United States -- Indiana","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781303726781","","","","","Social sciences; International relations; Central Asia; Kazakhstan; Kyrgyz Republic; Regional subsystem; Tajikistan; Trade; Turkmentistan; Uzbekistan; Visits; Water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although Bulgakov provides a number of references to Pseudo-Dionysius and draws on his ideas extensively, no single study exists dedicated to Bulgakov’s appropriation of Pseudo-Dionysius. </p> <p>We argue that in order to engage fully with Bulgakov’s ideas there is a need to approach his texts not as <em>sui generis</em> theological or philosophical system but as an interpretation of traditional Christian theology as found in scriptural, liturgical and patristic sources. The main difference between these two approaches is that, while the former envisages only one logical level – the logic of the whole system (otherwise the system would disintegrate), the latter presupposes a parallel existence in the same text (or body of texts) of two distinct logical levels – the logic of that which is being interpreted, and the logic of the interpreter (the ‘metalanguage’). We also argue that the same approach can be applied to the analysis of the <em>Corpus Dionysiacum</em>. </p> <p>Thus, we distinguish three different theological languages in the writings on angels by Pseudo-Dionysius and Bulgakov. In Part 1 of the thesis we begin the reconstruction of their angelologies by analysing their respective metalanguages of hierarchy and Sophia. In Part 2, we proceed by engaging with the philosophical language of nature and hypostasis in both authors. In the final chapters of the thesis, in Part 3, we turn to the most fundamental level, which is referred to as the language of anthropology. This language is based on the immediate human experience of angels – the manner in which angels are depicted in the Bible, in visions and accounts of mystic experiences. We demonstrate that the anthropological and philosophical languages are continually reinterpreted by Pseudo-Dionysius in his metalanguage of hierarchy, and by Bulgakov in his metalanguage of Sophiology.</p>","2019","2022-10-03 04:46:28","2022-10-03 04:46:28","2022-10-03 04:46:28","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oxford","","English","","http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","","","ora.ox.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This case study focused on an Hispanic family consisting of a (never married) single mother and her nine-year-old daughter. The mother was having great difficulty getting her daughter to follow the rules and with discipline at home. The mother left her country (Mexico), escaping from her abusive live-in-boyfriend (who is the daughter's biological father). While they were in treatment, the child disclosed that her father had molested her two months prior to coming to the United States. The mother suffered a great deal of fear and guilt resulting from her inability to protect her daughter. Also, her parenting skills were deficient. The structure of this family was characterized by difficulty with boundaries, enmeshment and distortion of the hierarchical structure. Method. Structural Family Therapy combined with some Behavioral Family Therapy techniques were the theoretical orientations used in this case study. Both theoretical orientations complemented each other and helped the therapist to alter the dysfunctional family structure. Also, this mother (during her parenting classes taken simultaneously with the family therapy) gained knowledge of self-control and child developmental stages, which helped her better understand her daughter's behaviors. This mother developed appropriate parenting skills, which helped her parent without abusing her daughter, and also learned how to meet her daughter's needs. Results. During 12 treatment sessions, the family structure was altered in a positive way. The mother was able to reduce her fears and execute an effective hierarchical role. She replaced a chaotic pattern of communication with more effective communication and strengthened subsystem boundaries. Finally, this mother learned to use her extended family as a support system and to feel confident executing her parental role. She also become comfortable with her ability to protect her daughter from the abusive father (who resides in Mexico).","","2022-10-03 04:46:35","2022-10-03 04:46:35","2022-10-03 04:46:35","","139","","","","","","","","","","United States International University","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Psy.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780591643657","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology; child abuse; sexual abuse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines design as a form of control that induces users' behavior in space through formal and informal rules. These rules limit acceptable actions that can be conducted in spaces. This study thus asks, “what can we learn from teens’ use of open space? How can we facilitate creativity and freedom within the realm of designed space? It explores behavior through observations, interviews, and site drawings in three appropriated spaces in the Bay Area of California: a stairwell, a public plaza, and a convenience store parking lot. It includes the researcher’s reflections about her interactions with the teens involved and the effect of her personal identity on the outcomes. The study hypothesizes that teens' reasons for appropriating these places include a combination of exclusion from open spaces by socially dominant groups and the users’ need to express independence. This hypothesis was only partially supported by findings. Teenage users expressed feelings of belonging and ownership in these places and exhibited creative ways of using the built environment. This study demonstrates that the fields of design, planning, and policy can better serve this population by relaxing their control of users and of the built environment to allow for more creativity, freedom, and active appropriation.","2014","2022-10-03 04:46:40","2022-10-03 04:46:40","2022-10-03 04:46:40","","","","","","","","","","","","Columbia University","","en","","","","","academiccommons.columbia.edu","","DOI: 10.7916/D898855X","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The article tests the theory on American FIRC attempts from 1947 to 1989, covert and overt, failed and successful, proposing that when a hierarchy member or neutral state engaged in economic expropriation, this signaled possible exit from the US hierarchy and/or entry into the Soviet hierarchy, making a US FIRC attempt against that state more likely.

Among the topics covered are the relation between economic change and transaction costs, the role which markets play as catalysts of the division of labor, a proposal for measuring the division of labor empirically, and a central hypothesis regarding the relation between economic coordination by markets and by hierarchies. The last section of the paper contains a few consequences for antitrust policy.

Yet gaps in service provision and differences in service utilization often result in within-country disparities in health outcomes. This poses a formidable challenge in the equitable delivery of health care for governments in developing countries. Poor availability of geographic data also attenuates the ability of researchers to examine equity in the spatial distribution of health facilities in relation to the population demand. This dissertation examines spatial equity in access to health services and in the utilization of maternal and reproductive health services in the context of Bangladesh. By examining the spatial distribution of public health facilities in Bangladesh, this research seeks to answer policy relevant questions on factors inﬂuencing differencing within regions, which in turn can help the government respond better to the challenges of disparities. This research consists of two components. The ﬁrst component examines spatial equity in the distribution of tertiary and secondary level health facilities using the lens of central place theory and urban hierarchy, while the second section examines mismatch in the supply and demand for primary health care services. In order to examine spatial equity in the distribution of tertiary and secondary public health services, this research uses geo-spatial data from the Government of Bangladesh in combination with the Demographic and Health Survey data from 2011 for Barisal and Sylhet Division of Bangladesh. Contrary to the assumption of urban hierarchy and central place theory which suggests market areas to be homogeneous for the same type of goods and services, this research ﬁnds substantial amount of within region variation in travel distance for the same type of health services. This research ﬁnds that inequality in access to public health facilities is inﬂuenced by the heterogeneous size of the administrative units to which they are linked. To test the spatial mismatch hypothesis, this dissertation used bivariate kernel density estimation technique to examine whether the distribution of the clinics followed population distribution. This analysis ﬁnds a greater concentration of clinics in rural areas than urban areas. This implies lower access to primary health care for the urban population. This methodology to assess spatial inequity can be useful in the context of developing countries where covariate data may not be reliable or available. This research provides recommendation to the Government of Bangladesh to capitalize on its vast distribution of primary health care facilities, with services aimed at improving the overall population health. Overall, it was found that with regard to hospital services, urban consumers in the city corporation had better access while communities living further from the city corporations and district centers were at a disadvantage; whereas in the case of primary health care, rural consumers had better access while urban consumers in the most densely populated places had limited access.","2017-12","2022-10-03 04:47:27","2022-10-03 04:47:27","2022-10-03 04:47:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","©2017 Priyanka D.

Examination of vertebrate faunal remains and bone tools derived from them provides a considerable amount of information not available in the historic record from contact period sites such as Colony Ross. Over 15,000 mammal bones from four sites of roughly the same time period inside and outside the stockade walls were examined in detail. Quantitative methods include determination of numbers of identified specimens, minimum numbers of individuals, skeletal element distribution, and taxonomic distributions. Evidence of modification such as butchery marks, impaction and fragmentation, burning, and tool production is also discussed. The mammal assemblage in general is considerably different from other coastal Californian archaeological sites. Three primary areas of occupation at Colony Ross show strong ethnic differentiation. The stockade complex mammal remains exhibit a strong European dietary pattern, focusing on domesticated mammals. The Mad-Shui-Nui area remains show a strong Californian dietary pattern, focusing on deer, and including consumption of cattle and sheep. The Native Alaskan neighborhood has a pattern found nowhere else at Colony Ross. Faunal remains from this area are dominated by marine mammals, specifically seal and sea lions, followed closely by domesticated and wild artiodactyls. There is some evidence of dietary accommodation of European foods by Native Americans at Colony Ross. For example, analysis of cutmarks shows that the vast majority of butchering was done with metal tools, and domestic mammals such as sheep and cattle were important parts of the diets in all areas of Colony Ross examined. The evidence so far points to the retention of basic traditional dietary patterns by the Alaskans, as indicated by a high percentage of seal remains, and flipper elements in particular. There is also strong evidence of the use of Native Californian foods. Many bone artifacts have also been recovered from excavation of the Native Alaskan Neighborhood at Ross. These bone artifacts range from finished tools to preforms, carving and chopping flakes, and other remnants of the manufacturing process. It appears that the majority of these bone artifacts were produced using metal tools, a postcontact innovation. However, the bone tools recovered from the Native Alaskan neighborhood that show evidence of metal tool use are stylistically virtually identical to precontact artifacts recovered from coastal Alaskan archaeological sites. It is clear that this traditional practice was persistent and important part of Native Alaskan identity at Colony Ross.

Violent crime is itself undergoing a recognizably similar hierarchical diffusion from the largest U.S. cities into smaller metropolitan regions. Further analysis suggests that continuation of public policies of “benign neglect” and “planned shrinkage” directed against marginalized urban populations may trigger a strong stochastic resonance which can significantly degrade public health and public order for much of the three-quarters of the U.S. population living in or near cities, in effect reversing the mortality transition of the last century.","1997-04-01","2022-10-03 04:47:34","2022-10-03 04:47:34","2022-10-03 04:47:34","935-947","","7","44","","Social Science & Medicine","The hierarchical diffusion of AIDS and violent crime among U.S. metropolitan regions","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","marginalization; AIDS; hierarchical diffusion; violent crime","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such spread, occurring along the commuting field defined by the daily journey to work, and along national travel routes connecting metropolitan regions, is characterized, respectively, as ?spatially contagious' and as ?hierarchical? by geographers. Here we explore the nested ecology of these and similar infections by using the martingale theorem of probability theory to study the endemic limit and apply Ito's stochastic calculus to analyze the approach to endemicity. We find that increasing segregation and marginalization of subpopulations creates, in terms of incurable infectious disease, the paradox of a highly integrated apartheid system, entraining the rich into the diseases of the poor across vast scales of space and population, in effect poisoning the public health well for all. We suggest that, on the global scale, analogous processes can entrain the affluent North into the suffering of the South, particularly through the importation and redistribution of emerging infections.","1999-10-01","2022-10-03 04:47:35","2022-10-03 04:47:35","2022-10-03 04:47:35","1787-1803","","10","31","","Environ Plan A","Emerging Infections and Nested Martingales","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The growth of organized science raises the question of whether we also see a bureaucratic structuring of scientific work groups as predicted by organization theory, with implications for the academic credit system and scientific labor markets. Building on organization theory, we examine the relation between project group size, technical environment, and bureaucratic structuring of scientific work. Using survey data on scientific projects, we find size predicts bureaucratic structuring, with declining marginal effects. We also find that interdisciplinarity and task interdependence have distinct effects on bureaucratic structuring.

Similar to other studies of dogs and wolves, we found significant linear dominance hierarchies based on highly unidirectional displays of submission and aggression. Submission was the most frequent, unidirectional and linear type of agonistic behaviour and, therefore, a better indicator of status than aggression or dominance displays. Aggression was low intensity, consisting mainly of ritualized threats with no physical contact, and conflicts involving physical contact were never injurious. Older dogs out-ranked younger dogs, but size was unrelated to dominance rank. Dominance relationships were more often expressed in same-sex dyads than between males and females. The coverage of dominance relationships in the daycare group was low compared to that reported for sexually intact dogs and wolves, which was probably a result of reduced competition due to neutering and other human influences. In many dyads dogs never exchanged agonistic behaviours, but bi-directional relationships were rare, and most dogs formed some dominance relationships with other dogs. Except for their low coverage, muzzle licks met the criteria for a formal display of submission. Our results suggest that dominance remains a robust component of domestic dog behaviour even when humans significantly reduce the potential for resource competition. The possible proximate benefits of dominance relationships for dogs are discussed.","2015","2022-10-04 23:53:47","2022-10-04 23:53:47","2022-10-04 23:53:47","677-704","","5","152","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Brill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fragmentation is not necessarily a problem, insofar as there may be no need for coordination among different legal regimes.  But where it does raise issues of conflict, or presents opportunities for synergy, it is useful to inquire whether fragmentation might be managed in a way that would reduce inefficient conflict, or harvest synergies.  The existing formal system for management, provided in the VCLT, is quite limited in its response, and the outcomes that it produces would not necessarily be substantively satisfactory.  This article reviews a number of types of responses that states might determine to use, in order to increase coherence.  States can establish informal coordination mechanisms, and perhaps provide a mandate to international organizations to coordinate with one another.  They can establish enforcement institutions for one regime that effectively structurally subordinates the law included in another regime.  They can establish specific rules or general standards for the relationship between different rules.  These rules or standards can constitute varying degrees of delegation to courts that may be established to address these issues.","2011-08-12","2022-10-04 23:54:22","2022-10-04 23:54:22","2022-10-04 23:54:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","fragmentation; trade; international law; jurisdiction; subsidiarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1908862","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"JB5K4QXG","thesis","2019","Tonks, Sarah Louise","Understanding street gang membership","","","","","https://etheses.bham.ac.uk/id/eprint/9965/","Over the last thirty years, academics have focused attention on the ambiguity surrounding what constitutes a gang as well as the engagement factors for joining a street gang. Whilst the rehabilitation of street gang offenders and understanding the reasons to desist from this lifestyle is paramount to counteract the effects of gang membership, less attention has been given to these areas.   The first chapter discusses some of the definitional issues that have arisen from exploring gang phenomenon and a historical account of the theories that underpin gang membership. The second chapter introduces the first systematic literature review to have been undertaken on gang disengagement in order to understand the factors which increase the likelihood that an individual will leave a gang. This review highlighted that there is not one definitive reason as to why individuals choose to leave and a range of factors are detailed. An empirical project is presented in Chapter 3; with the first study focusing on the impact two generalised violent offender behaviour programmes (RESOLVE and Self Change Programme; SCP) had on both adult violent gang and adult violent non-gang offenders.  Findings suggested that both sets of RESOLVE participants were found to have made treatment gains for impulsivity, anger and aggression, and treatment readiness. A statistically significant difference was observed for vengeful thinking, with gang participants showing a greater change in scores. SCP data showed statistically significant differences post treatment with lower levels of impulsivity, anger, vengeful thinking and beliefs supportive of aggression and an increase in treatment readiness. For non-gang participants, statistically significant differences were found post treatment for impulsivity and aggression. No significant interaction was observed between offender typologies, suggesting that the two groups have similar presentations. The second study explored the views of gang members who had completed either of the programmes mentioned in order to gain further insight into gang membership.   Three major themes emerged which centred on what a street gang is; motivators to join; and motivators to disengage. The results are discussed with reference to current practice, the limitations, and recommendations for further research.  Chapter 4 presents a critical analysis of the Psychological Inventory for Criminal Thinking Styles (PICTS, Walters, 1990). Although the PICTS continues to be used for research purposes and within forensic practice, the review found that caution should be exercised in its use and preferably in conjunction with other measures. This was partially due to the need for further independent research being needed across different cultural samples and the reported reliability and validity.  The thesis conclusions are presented in Chapter 5 with reference made to the need for further research into gang membership, especially within the UK.","2019-07","2022-10-04 23:56:33","2022-10-04 23:56:33","2022-10-04 23:56:33","","283","","","","","","","","","","University of Birmingham","","English","","d_fp","","","etheses.bham.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"KVQIB2LG","thesis","","Wandan, Solongo","Making New Rights: Constitutional Agenda-Setting in the Transitions of Poland (1989-1997) and South Africa (1990-1994 (1996))","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1557709261/abstract/939A81D1EF9A4AF4PQ/1","In my dissertation I investigate the process of how new rights get the status of constitutional rights, especially within democratic transitions. The mechanisms and actors involved in the creation of new rights have so far not been addressed sufficiently; instead existing approaches focus on the diffusion of generic templates of rights, or on the political interests of elites in the judicialization of politics. My dissertation offers an alternative explanation of rights creation. I argue that new rights are constitutionalized through political mechanisms familiar from regular democratic politics, understood as advocacy relations. New rights often do not enjoy widespread recognition at the time of drafting, and hence are not automatically included in draft bills of rights. Their consideration depends on active political interventions through mechanisms such as interest representation, lobbying, and coalition building. To explain the concrete dynamics and outcomes of this process, I develop an agenda-setting model of rights constitutionalization. In this model, new rights are created through partisan agenda-setting in which different actor groups enjoy constitutional initiative. Two factors determine the success of such rights initiatives: First, variation in constitutional agenda access advocates enjoy; and second, the politics around the rights claim once it is on the agenda, i.e., whether or not it is subject to partisan conflict and/or counter-mobilization. With this model I compare the drafting of bills of rights in Poland and South Africa. I study three new rights - gender equality, environmental rights, and sexual orientation - and base the analysis on an evaluation of expert interviews and original (archival) sources. The first result is that in none of the six cases new rights accessed the constitutional agenda because of the initiative of drafters; rather, most new rights were put on the agenda through lobbying by external actors, alone or in cooperation with sympathetic advocates. Secondly, once on the agenda, the likelihood of success is relatively high, as only those rights claims were fully/partially rejected that became subject of partisan conflict and/or counter-mobilization. New rights become part of bills of rights through political advocacy processes in which social movements, interest groups and ordinary citizens exert crucial constitutional initiative.","","2022-10-04 23:57:04","2022-10-04 23:57:04","2022-10-04 23:57:04","","290","","","","","Making New Rights","","","","","The New School","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781321010794","","","","","Social sciences; Poland; Agenda-setting; Constitution making; Democratization; Rights; South africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The online social world is reflecting our physical world in an increasingly detailed way by collecting people's individual biographies and their various of relationships with other people. Although massive amount of social data has been gathered, an urgent challenge remain unsolved, which is to discover meaningful knowledge that can empower the social platforms to really understand their users from different perspectives. Motivated by this trend, my research addresses the reasoning and mathematical modeling behind interesting phenomena on social networks. Proposing graph based data mining framework regarding to heterogeneous data sources is the major goal of my research. The algorithms, by design, utilize graph structure with heterogeneous link and node features to creatively represent social networks' basic structures and phenomena on top of them. The graph based heterogeneous mining methodology is proved to be effective on a series of knowledge discovery topics, including network structure and macro social pattern mining such as magnet community detection~\cite{GuanKDD12}, social influence propagation and social similarity mining~\cite{GuanCIKM12}, and spam detection~\cite{GuanICDM11}. The future work is to consider dynamic relation on social data mining and how graph based approaches adapt from the new situations.","2014-10-28","2022-10-04 23:57:15","2022-10-04 23:57:15","2022-10-04 23:57:15","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Illinois at Chicago","","en","","thesis","","","indigo.uic.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It asks three questions. First, why did the controversy happen when it did? Second, what made the flag exhibit controversial? Third, why were parties to the controversy drawn either to desecration arguments attacking the exhibit or to free speech arguments defending the exhibit? I apply three theoretical perspectives to understand the incident: moral panic, culture war, and class-based identity construction hypothesis. I argue that the controversial flag work cannot by itself explain the timing of the controversy. The timing had more to do with the politicization of the flag at the national level, racial politics at the local level, veterans' concerns for their own benefits, and the politics of the place where the exhibit was shown. I also argue, however, that the controversy was not merely a result of conflict over vested interests. The flag exhibit became the center of debate: (a) because it offended nationalist sentiments that were extremely fragile at the time, (b) because it resonated strongly with the culture war raging on in the country, and (c) because it reflected a deep gap between the art world and the lay community in their respective aesthetic judgments. Finally, I suggest that in pluralistic societies, the persuasiveness of a cultural interpretation may vary depending on the institutional domains within which it operates. Members of and contributors to the Art Institute embraced the free speech argument due to their own class-based libertarian orientations. The Park District Finance Committee rescinded its earlier decision to cut the Institute's funding mainly because of its own institutional rules, and the Cook County Circuit Court Judge found the free speech argument more persuasive primarily in light of the legal precedents set in flag desecration cases. Similarly, it was also the logic of public opinion and political elections that led to the desecration argument triumph over the free speech argument.","","2022-10-04 23:57:37","2022-10-04 23:57:37","2022-10-04 23:57:37","","174","","","","","The American flag as art and controversy","","","","","Texas A&M University","United States -- Texas","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493314815","","","","","Social sciences; Communication and the arts; American flag; Art; Chicago; Controversy; Flag-on-the-floor controversy; Illinois","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The facial image represents multi-dimensional observations of a city. Presented in this dissertation are a theory of city diagnosis, and a City Face Model (CFM). The theory of city diagnosis is derived from the philosophy that a city is a human organism and has a face representing its appearance, personality, life cycle and gender. Based on this theory, the CFM, as a ""user friendly'' computer package, is used to display, analyze and communicate capsule images or observations of a city.  The dissertation contains eight chapters, an annotated bibliography and five appendices. Basically, the eight chapters address two fundamental questions: what is the city and what is the face? Chapter six deals with the most creative part of the dissertation, the theoretical interpretation of the city as a face. Chapter Seven presents three sets of case studies. The first set shows research results on 58 medium-size American cities referring in general to age, gender, functions, facial colors and expressions utilizing data from 1972 and 1984. The second set presents a comparative analysis displaying the faces of four West Texas cities: Amarillo, Lubbock, Midland and Odessa. The analysis addresses the physical, social, governmental and economic traits of each city in addition to land use and environmental conditions. The third case study conducts an in-depth diagnosis of the city of Lubbock by interpreting 300 indicators. By taking an organic approach, the theory-along with the City Face Model presented in this dissertation-will connect city vitality and facial visibility. Thus, the CFM, serving as a mnemonic device, should help city planners to summarize the city into face(s). Faces can represent particular city functions or an overall picture of the city and provide essential and fundamental information to the public and the decision-makers.","1987-12","2022-10-04 23:57:44","2022-10-04 23:57:54","2022-10-04 23:57:44","","","","","","","Face as an image of the city","","","","","","","eng","Unrestricted.","","","","tdl-ir.tdl.org","","Accepted: 2016-11-14T23:17:01Z Publisher: Texas Tech University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this project, which includes the film Keep Fighting, is to examine the role of mixed martial arts in the lives of Marine Corps Veterans as a transitional vehicle to civilian life, as it relates to building a community, a sense of belonging, and reconstructing their identities as Marines in civilian society. Many male Marines have a predisposition towards exaggerated or idealized forms of masculinity (what is sometimes called “hypermasculinity”) that are encouraged by the Marine Corps, and this can be extremely alienating when Marines return to civilian life. Behaviors associated with hypermasculinity are a critical component of successful socialization of Marines in the Marine Corps culture and are fostered through formation and exhibition of aggression and discipline. In addition to reintegrating Marines’ back into social support systems such as communities and families, part of many male Marines' reintegration processes is finding a healthy way of expressing their masculinity within a civilian world that often conflates aggression and goal focused stoicism, that is the disposition to disregard the emotional aspects of accomplishing tasks or competing as toxic masculinity. This study proposes that martial arts may be one healthy avenue for Marines to articulate their hypermasculinity after they become civilians. This project is an attempt to illuminate a path of reintegration that looks to incorporate, instead of seeking to rehabilitate, a select veteran community through the same prism of hypermasculine social behaviors that were encouraged during their period of enlistment. I will use ethnographic film to explore how specific constructions of hypermasculine identity and community affect the individuals’ lives after the Marines. This will focus on those who participate in Sub-Fighter’s mixed martial arts program.","2020","2022-10-04 23:58:21","2022-10-04 23:58:21","2022-10-04 23:58:21","","71","","","","","Equipoise and Equanimity","","","","","California State University, Long Beach","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781658444415 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","","","","","violence; martial arts; socialization; transition; hypermasculinity; reintegration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Als Grundlage für die Analyse dienen die Romane von Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker und Toni Morrison. Der Beginn der Arbeit enthält biographische Informationen zu den Autorinnen sowie zum historischen Kontext in dem die Werke entstanden. Zentrale Frage dieser Arbeit ist, inwiefern die Sklavenerzählung als ""künstlerische"" Vorlage der hier gewählten Romane dient. Bei den Romanen handelt es sich um The Color Purple von Alice Walker, The Bluest Eye von Toni Morrison und Their Eyes Were Watching God von Zora Neale Hurston. Im Vorfeld der Analyse werden die formellen Charakteristika der Sklavenerzählung genau dargelegt, um in weiterer Folge die formellen sowie inhaltlichen Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede zwischen der Sklavenerzählung und den Romanen zu erörtern. Der afro-amerikanische Bildungsroman findet dabei ebenso Berücksichtigung, da er aus der Sklavenerzählung hervorgeht. Die weiblichen Charaktere in diesen Romanen werden quasi wie Sklaven behandelt und leben unter sklavenähnlichen Bedingungen. Sexismus und Rassismus spielen eine zentrale Rolle in der Sklavenerzählung und in den gewählten Romanen. Beide ""Konzepte"" dienen als Motor der Unterdrückung des weiblichen Geschlechts durch den schwarzen Mann. Der zweite Teil der Arbeit behandelt die verschiedenen Arten der Unterdrückung und Widerstandsstrategien der Frauen, die sie im Laufe ihres Lebens entwickeln. Die anschließende Analyse unterscheidet zwischen familiärer Unterdrückung durch den Vater und Ehemann und gesellschaftlicher Unterdrückung. This thesis deals with examples of black women?s oppression by black men in black women's writing. As a basis, selected novels by Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker, and Toni Morrison are looked at in detail. A brief introduction of the authors' lives and the historical context in which they wrote and published their fiction is given in the beginning of this thesis. Subsequently, the question as to what extent the slave narrative can be regarded as artistic context in The Color Purple by Walker, The Bluest Eye by Morrison, and Their Eyes Were Watching God by Hurston is addressed. In order to answer this question, this thesis examines whether formal as well as textual characteristics of the slave narrative genre are present in the selected works. In addition to the slave narrative, the African American Bildungsroman that evolved from the slave narrative genre is also considered in the analysis. The female characters in these novels are quasi treated as slaves and live in conditions resembling slavery. What slave narratives and the respective novels have in common are their concepts behind the oppression. The concepts of sexism and racism loom large in these novels and are the engine for the oppression of black women by black men. Thus, the second part deals with the various types of oppression and the resistance strategies the female characters develop over the course of their lives. Thereby, oppression exerted on the females by their family members, such as father and husband, is distinguished from the oppression by people in the community those women live in.","2013","2022-10-04 23:58:31","2022-10-04 23:58:31","2022-10-04 23:58:31","","","","","","","Black males as oppressors in black women’s writing","","","","","","","eng","","","","43ACC_UBG","Library Catalog (Visual Library 2021)","UG:GW:AM","Accession Number: AC11039169 Source: UBG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we report on a study of the nature of different aspects of leadership in agile teams. We used an established model of leadership, distinguishing transactional and transformational styles, and asked IT professionals a set of questions about the leadership they experience, both from direct supervisors (hierarchical leadership) and from the team itself (shared leadership). We determined correlation measures of these four types of leadership with the extent of agility in the whole organization. Our results show that agility is indeed related to the transformational style, but that the transactional style also plays a part, especially as shared leadership. Furthermore, even in highly agile software development, leadership by direct supervisors still plays an important role. We propose that, as software development becomes more agile, the transactional aspects of leadership may shift away from the leadership dyad between supervisor and employee into the agile team, while transformational leadership is important for both the team and supervisors. We discuss our results in light of applications for both research and practice.","2022","2022-10-04 23:59:21","2022-10-04 23:59:21","","99-113","","","","","","Understanding Leadership in Agile Software Development Teams","Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Leadership; Transformational leadership; Shared leadership; Agile software development; Transactional leadership","Stray, Viktoria; Stol, Klaas-Jan; Paasivaara, Maria; Kruchten, Philippe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results generally support our hypotheses that masculine communication style is related to hierarchical advancement (e.g., number of promotions, advancement to higher managerial levels), whereas feminine communication style is related to non-hierarchical rewards (e.g., higher compensation, increased span of control). Unexpectedly, feminine communication style also positively predicts two indicators of hierarchical career success. Furthermore, an interaction effect suggests that gendered communication style has more of an impact on women?s compensation than on men?s.","2019-06-01","2022-10-04 23:59:31","2022-10-04 23:59:31","2022-10-04 23:59:31","456-502","","4","46","","","Gendered Communication and Career Outcomes","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But such an account of motivation is psychologically incomplete; it has been well-established that human beings are motivated by more than calculations of power and interest. In particular, social psychology has demonstrated that humans are motivated by normative concerns, the pursuit of which may, under certain circumstances, result in behavior inconsistent with self-interest classically understood. This study assesses the power and instrumentality of a particular type of normative motivation--the justice motive--in the outbreak of eight Great Power wars. These wars are among those that Realist theory would expect to be least influenced by considerations other than power and interest. The wars studied include the Franco-Spanish war (1823); the Crimean war (1853-1856); the Franco-Prussian war (1870-1871); the Russo-Japanese war (1904-1905); World War I (1914-1918); World War II (1939-1945); the Vietnam war (1965-1973); and the Falklands/Malvinas war (1982). In six of the eight cases (all but the Franco-Prussian and Russo-Japanese wars), the justice motive played an important and sometimes crucial role. Sensitivity to the presence and action of the justice motive enables us to explain various features of these wars that resist a Realist analysis. Having demonstrated the importance of the justice motive in the outbreak of these wars, the study concludes by examining the meaning of justice across borders, with an eye to clarifying its relationship to international order. It is argued that there is considerable scope for creative institution-building in the pursuit of a just world order, but that the existence of the empirical-normative gap in political science makes progress in that direction considerably more difficult.","","2022-10-05 00:00:21","2022-10-05 00:00:21","2022-10-05 00:00:21","","573","","","","","","","","","","Harvard University","United States -- Massachusetts","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798641985053","","","","","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) are endorsed by federal and state governments, Wall Street and employers as the best response to the failure of traditional market forces as well as the cottage industry approach to health care delivery. HMOs are experimenting with capitation as a payment methodology in which health care providers are placed at financial risk for managing the care of a population of patients for a fixed monthly budget. The medical practice as an organization is required to change the way the practice is structured to cope and thrive in the current market turmoil. This research focuses on how primary care medical practices are restructuring in response to the public policy decision of HMOs to reimburse physicians through capitation. A new model is postulated for measuring organizational structure using Robbin's three core dimensions of structure (complexity, formalization and centralization). A national trade association of medical practices provides the population for distribution of a new survey instrument. One hundred eighteen primary care medical practices representing 626,059 capitation patients under the care of 1582 primary care physicians in 35 states volunteered to participate in the research. The respondents are divided into study groups based on the level of capitation in each practice. Study group scores are analyzed utilizing one-way analysis of variance and follow up tests. Even when adjusted for practice size, results indicate that medical practices with more than 10% capitation as a reimbursement system are significantly different for the three core dimensions of structure. This research introduces a new model and a new instrument, creates measurable dimensions of structure and isolates fifty distinctive organizational behaviors that represent significant restructuring among the participating medical practices.","","2022-10-05 00:01:45","2022-10-05 00:01:45","2022-10-05 00:01:45","","265","","","","","","","","","","Saint Louis University","United States -- Missouri","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780599444768","","","","","Social sciences; Primary care; Health and environmental sciences; Capitation; HMOs; Medical practices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"BQLXKLA7","thesis","2020","Welsh, Michael Tyler","Disruptive rhetoric in an age of outrage","","","","","https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/82214","Abstract: Online discursive practices often take place within a context know as an age of outrage. This culture of outrage dominates the current socio-political condition showing few, if any, signs of subsiding. In fact, this project suggests that outrage culture is an inescapable societal framework within which rhetors operate today. Outrage culture can be understood as the tendency for individuals to react publicly to any rhetorical action that is deemed offensive, insensitive, or uncivil in nature. These outraged reactions are often mob-like in nature; they are polarized, politicized, and enacted quickly without further investigation into the context, meaning, and intentions of the original rhetorical action. This project asks: under what circumstances can rhetors offer stylized answers  for dealing with socio-political issues in an age of outrage? This research reveals that some rhetors use disruptive rhetoric to challenge hierarchical structures, utilizing the rhetorical concept of “impiety,” which in turn can create publics within digital, discursive spaces. These digitally networked publics demonstrate how groups coalesce and self-organize in order to discuss, negotiate, and contest meaning in response to disruptive acts. This project also proposes that affective releases can sustain networked publics through public displays of emotion and intensity as they seek to reorder and reorganize disrupted hierarchies. Archival research on digital platforms provides digital methods to locate the formulation of these networked, affective publics by tracking specific hashtags responding to disruptive rhetorical strategies. Hashtags become sites of affect wherein publics debate, deliberate, and contest deeper meanings of messages offered by disruptive rhetors. Additionally, this project utilizes close reading methods to reveal the affective nature of these hashtagged responses, which create rhetorical space for publics to feel their way into understanding. This project’s goal is to not only propose new approaches for understanding disruptive rhetorical strategies, but also offer methods to track and locate future disruptions in an age of outrage.","2020-04-23","2022-10-05 00:01:52","2022-10-05 00:01:52","2022-10-05 00:01:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","Thesis","","","repositories.lib.utexas.edu","","Accepted: 2020-07-20T18:53:33Z DOI: 10.26153/tsw/9219","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"89ECZ2H5","report","","Werner, Jake","The Sources of China’s Vision for Global Economic Governance","","","","","","In both the United States and China, opinion has moved from a cautious embrace of the other to a conviction that earlier collaboration was naïve and that a “clear-eyed” analysis discloses the other to be possessed of a fundamentally hostile essence. In Washington, policymakers increasingly view Chinese economic statecraft as an attack on the ideals of a neutral market framework and call for confrontational measures to save the liberal international order. This paper argues that such an approach reads present-day tensions back into recent history and, in the process, effaces new possibilities for resolving today’s conflicts. China’s vision of global economic governance is not external to the liberal international order but emerged from China’s particular position within it. A critical understanding of China’s vision and how it arose is essential to rethinking globalization’s possible futures.","","2022-10-05 00:03:19","2022-10-05 00:03:52","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although, African cotton is generally  cheaper to produce, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali have experienced difficulties to  maintain competitiveness on the market. The reason is cotton subsidies, which are  stimulus of price settings, and therefore prejudicing for cotton production in smaller  economies. Thus, the sector has caused economic issues due to distribution of subsidies,  which has also resulted in a politic value of the crop. There are several studies that relate  the institutional theory on institution structure, legislation and decision-making processes  within the WTO, but not many are directly applied on the cotton dilemma. Still, the  cotton issue is a case study that demonstrates something greater; being a very central  issue on the WTO agenda - it is an example on WTO multinational structures, and  demonstrates how less powerful Member countries put their interests on the WTO  agenda.  The first formal complaint at the WTO on US cotton subsidies was carried out by Brazil  in 2002, asserting that the US subsidies on cotton ignored the global trade agreements.  Subsidies were declared to cause reduction in export profit and recession in price, which  made it difficult for minor producers to be competitive on the global cotton market. In the  end of April 2003, the C4 laid out a proposition on how to resolve the issues of cotton  subsidies. However, the C4 proposition failed, with no outcome. In December 2013, C4  forwarded a second proposal for cotton during the WTO Ministerial Conference in Bali. It  was grounded on developing countries progress and ability in the trade of cotton. The  meeting agreed on implementation of the so-called Bali-package, where the C4 proposal  was included. The WTO dispute mechanism purpose is to provide countries to solve  disagreements through discussion rather than war. Cotton is currently very much a part on  the WTO agenda, and the gradual change of attitude towards the cotton issue will  hopefully give the Bali-package prospects and efficiency. However, it is difficult to  evaluate legal aspects against political, and legal decision-making have to be  implemented in order to make a difference.","2014-07-01","2022-10-05 00:04:19","2022-10-05 00:04:25","2022-10-05 00:04:19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","gupea.ub.gu.se","","Accepted: 2014-07-01T13:08:23Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, these subjects provide new opportunities to challenge our understanding of the processes that reshaped the nation's postwar urban landscape. This dissertation looks at cultural initiatives and spaces of leisure as a way to understand the larger social, economic, and political forces that shaped Los Angeles after World War II--specifically, the Hollywood Bowl, the L.A. Music Center, the L.A. County Museum of Art, and Elysian Park. The construction and revitalization of these public spaces offers new avenues for examining the role of urban planning and policy in remaking American cities in the postwar era. Each of these spaces would add to a modern urban identity being crafted by metropolitan leaders. On its own, each chapter tells a unique and captivating story of civic negotiation. Yet, these episodes collectively tell an even more important story about the broader postwar project to remake L.A., as each space was shaped by the same people, agencies, and policies within the short span of twenty-five years. Thus, my primary objective in this dissertation is to examine not only the significance of constructing cultural spaces in the project to remake L.A. into a national cultural epicenter, but also what that story reveals about postwar urban growth and urban renewal policy in Los Angeles. This dissertation invites readers to rethink the parameters of urban renewal by considering cultural and leisure spaces as a lens through which to understand the post-World War II project of city building. This research builds on the work of urban historians, cultural historians, and policy historians to frame a new set of questions about the ways in which cultural institution-building came to fruition through broader urban renewal initiatives. I argue that the construction and revival of cultural and leisure spaces in Los Angeles after World War II sparked the beginnings of a rapidly growing cultural infrastructure intended to displace New York as the nation's premier cultural metropolis. Further, civic leaders would increasingly rely on urban renewal policy to construct cultural spaces, and in the process come to discover that culture could function well as urban renewal. Yet, the success of these institutions was limited. This emerging concept of culture as urban renewal occurred within the context of a political realignment that saw an extended period of alliance between businessmen, county and city officials, and cultural philanthropists who came together to support pro-growth initiatives, many of which centered on downtown. By rethinking conventional narratives of urban renewal, this research shows how crucial leisure spaces were to remaking American cities after World War II.","","2022-10-05 00:06:32","2022-10-05 00:06:32","2022-10-05 00:06:32","","477","","","","","Culture as urban renewal","","","","","University of California, Santa Barbara","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781303732003","","","","","Social sciences; Culture; Los angeles; Parks; Performing arts; Postwar; Urban renewal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mapping the social and cultural worlds of high school girls through their stances and responses to literature","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/305431279/abstract/A655ACFCCD4940C9PQ/1","This qualitative, ethnographic study examines the ways in which racially diverse, working-class high school girls' responses to classroom literature are embedded in local discourses of the classroom; institutional discourses of the school; and gendered, cultural discourses and practices acquired in community, family, and peer-group worlds. This research sheds light on discourses, cultural models, and narratives that girls use in positioning their stances toward literature read in the classroom. In addition, this research yields implications for choice of classroom texts and pedagogical practices in teaching literature that are more equitable for all students. This study examines several questions. (1) How do high school girls respond to and use literature read within the school-sanctioned classroom curriculum? (2) How are these responses related to the teacher's pedagogical moves; the local, social context of the classroom; and the institutional culture of the school? (3) How are these responses related to the gendered, cultural contexts of communities, families, and peer groups? (4) How does negotiation of social worlds within texts, both those read inside and outside of the classroom curriculum, affect girls' negotiation and construction of gendered identities in their lived worlds? This qualitative, ethnographic study was conducted over the course of two school years in a diverse, urban high school in a working-class neighborhood of a large Midwestern city. Primary participants in this study were female students enrolled in the courses. These girls participated in focus groups and interviews inquiring about their social worlds, their thoughts on texts read in class, and their reflections on class discussions and activities. The data record was analyzed through a process of thematic coding as well as Critical Discourse Analysis (Fairclough, 2003; Gee, 1999). Results from this study suggest that understanding girls' participation in social worlds and discourse communities helps us understand their stances toward literature. This research also suggests that teaching girls literacy practices of negotiating across texts may help them negotiate across competing social worlds in their lived experiences.","","2022-10-05 00:06:43","2022-10-05 00:06:43","2022-10-05 00:06:43","","292","","","","","Discourses of femininity?","","","","","University of Minnesota","United States -- Minnesota","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780542013324","","","","","Social sciences; Education; Discourses; Femininity; Girls; High school","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"HEHVLJB7","thesis","2000","Thekiso, Abel Thabo","Perceptual differences between managers and subordinates regarding leadership styles","","","","","http://scholar.ufs.ac.za/xmlui/handle/11660/8220","English: Maribi Company acknowledged that perceptual differences between managers and  subordinates are likely to occur, and that may lead to communication gaps that in turn may  hamper the relationship between managers and their subordinates. Since healthy  relationships between managers and their subordinates are a strong motivational tool, the  company believes that it is imperative that possible perceptual distortions be identified and  addressed in order to create an atmosphere of constructive, supportive eo operation  envirorunent that will increase productivity levels.  The current study was therefore set about by the Maribi Company to investigate. and  determine the perceptual differences that might occur between managers and their  subordinates with regard to the manager's leadership styles.  In reviewing the literature, perception and leadership were dealt with in separate chapters.  In reviewing perception, the process commenced with the definition of perception,  followed by the perception process, then factors influencing perception, and the influence  of perception on human behaviour.  The chapter regarding leadership was commenced by the definition of leadership, various  theories of leadership, the most recent approaches to leadership, participative leadership,  factors forcing organisations to move towards participation, the praxis of leadership,  essential practices of exemplary leadership, research findings regarding subordinate's  perceptions of leader's practices, and research finding regarding follower's cultural  orientation and task structure.  It was evident from the literature that, whether or not the manager successfully plans or  organizes the work of his or her subordinates and actually helps them to structure their  work more efficiently and effectively is far less important than how subordinates perceive  the manager's efforts.  It was also discovered from the literature study that that effective leadership is a function  of specific qualities of the leader, a balance between task and relationship orientation and  characteristic of the situation as well.  The methodology utilized in the process was to target a company that produces liquor in  the central region which has depots Free State, North West, and part of the Northern  Cape. The company was given a pseudo name (Maribi) for the sake of anonymity.  The population of the area investigated was of heterogeneous nature, characterised by  people speaking Tswana, S.Sotho, Afrikaans , and English being a dominant language in  the company.  A sample of 136 respondents has been randomly selected. The data was gathered by  personally visiting the respective depots and relevant respondents being given  questionnaires to fin in whiles the researcher was there to clarify misunderstandings. The  Leadership Process Inventory which made provision for five distinctive leadership  practices (challenging the process, impiring a shared vision, enabling others to act,  modeling the way, and encouraging the heart) was used as a measuring instrument.  The standard SPSS computer program was used to conduct a multivariate analysis of  variance to determine the differences in perceptions between managers and their  subordinates with regard to managers leadership styles.  Highly significant differences between managers and subordinates regarding the leadership  styles of ""challenging the process"" and ""enabling others to act"" have been identified.  Significant differences between managers and subordinates occur regarding the leadership  styles of ""rnodeling the way"" and ""encouraging the heart"".  Conclusions made out of the study were that the perceptual differences between managers  and their subordinates regarding the leadership styles of managers can be attributed to the  perceptual distortion that occur during the respective stages of the perceptual process, i.e.  the selection, the organization and the interpretation of information. It was also concluded  that the perceptual difference can probably also be ascribed to a lack of communication  between managers and subordinates.  It was therefore recommended that a questionnaire that cover a broader range of  leadership styles be used or developed, and that the sample size be extended to more than  one organization. It was further recommended that the explanation for significance  differences between managers and subordinates regarding the application and practical  implementation of the respective leadership styles be investigated and addressed. With  regard to the relative significance and impact of perceptual differences between managers  and subordinates pertaining to leadership styles, it was recommended that the matter be  investigated further in order to minimize a potential negative effect on the outcome of this  relationship.","2000-09","2022-10-05 00:07:07","2022-10-05 00:07:12","2022-10-05 00:07:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","University of the Free State","","","","scholar.ufs.ac.za","","Accepted: 2018-04-20T06:27:55Z Publisher: University of the Free State","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first has been concerned with identifying the intrinsic characteristics of an innovation that influence its adoption; the second has considered factors not directly related to the innovation itself. The purposes of this paper are to briefly consider the  contribution that research has made to an understanding of educational change and to offer a model--the planar--that may assist administrators in effecting beneficial educational change.

It also examines the differences in these interpersonal needs for Blacks and Whites. The 58 couples in this study were volunteers, all of whom were involved in full-time pursuit of professional careers, and all of whom possessed an earned bachelor's degree or higher. The sample population consisted of 28 Black and 26 White couples. Couples completed the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test to determine the degree to which they were satisfied with their marriage, and the FIRO-B, to identify their needs for control and affection. T-tests and Pearson correlations were used to test the hypotheses. The alpha level was.05. Analysis of the data indicated that the interpersonal need for affection is more significantly related to marital satisfaction among dual-career couples, than is the need for control. The results further identified differences in need for control and affection between husbands and wives, and Blacks and Whites. This exploratory study identifies several areas for further research on those interpersonal needs that affect dual-career couples, and an examination of how those needs may differ according to race and gender.","","2022-10-05 00:09:52","2022-10-05 00:09:52","2022-10-05 00:09:52","","141","","","","","The relationship of interpersonal needs for control and affection to marital satisfaction","","","","","The George Washington University","United States -- District of Columbia","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780591129120","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology; Education; Black couples","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Her half-sister Mary bequeathed her a country financially weak, religiously divided, and politically impotent. Elizabeth's councilors and advisors saw only one path to England's recovery: the queen was to marry and produce a male heir. Elizabeth, however, refused to allow her female body to limit her ability to rule her country. The crown symbolized more that the physical body of the ruler who wore it; it stood for the people and country of England. Building on notions of the body politic reaching back to Plato, affirmed by early Christians, and revived by civic humanists in the Renaissance, Elizabeth realized the importance of the ""Idea of Monarchy"" and used this imagery to great success in her speeches, writings, and representations. This thesis will argue that Elizabeth used the body politic as her main form of political propaganda, and due to her successful employment of such rhetoric her reign is now seen as a golden age in English history.","","2022-10-05 00:10:17","2022-10-05 00:10:17","2022-10-05 00:10:17","","69","","","","","","","","","","College of Charleston","United States -- South Carolina","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781124620107","","","","","Social sciences; Body politic; Elizabeth I; Queen of England; Starkey; Thomas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Set in 1970s Taiwan during the Martial Law period, the novel's portrayal of the underground homosexual community and male prostitution culture based in Taipei's New Park (now 228 Park) did not capture critical attention or gain commercial success when published, owing to the then conservative social atmosphere. Nonetheless, after the lifting of Martial Law, as Taiwan became a democratised nation with mature elective democracy and participation in globalised cultural circuits, Niezi became canonised and politicised as the iconic text for a sequence of social activism regarding homosexual human rights in academia and related cultural activities in the 1990s and 2000s. Even today, Niezi is still considered the most debatable representative homosexual literary text in Taiwan's homosexual community. While Niezi's iconic status has stood the test of time over the past three decades, the changing interpretations of the text offer a great resource through which to examine the representations of male homosexuality in Taiwan during this period. Taiwanese society transformed from an authoritarian regime in the 1970s and 1980s, to quasi-democracy in the early 1990s, then full elective democracy in the mid-1990s, and now Taiwan has fully joined the globalised circuits of the capitalist economy, with free markets, cross-cultural communication and rapid flows of information. This social transformation brought about changing interpretations of Niezi, in which male homosexuality was no longer a social taboo, and activist cultural critics started to demand equal rights for homosexuals inspired by Euro-American theoretical discourse and social reform. The social transformation also saw two visual adaptations of the novel through the forms of film and television, which I shall examine in this thesis. I will also demonstrate not just how male homosexuality has been represented in different social contexts, but also what has contributed to the endurance of Niezi's legacies in the past three decades. In addition, while there was a great amount of homosexual literature produced after the lifting of Martial Law owing to social liberalisation, the thesis will also consider Niezi's continuing iconic status.","","2022-10-05 00:10:32","2022-10-05 00:10:32","2022-10-05 00:10:32","","203","","","","","Niezi and Its Legacies","","","","","The University of Manchester (United Kingdom)","England","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781073917402","","","","","Social sciences; (UMI)AAI10590098; Male homosexuality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The studies found that group categorisation was sufficient for the development of ingroup favouritism and outgroup discrimination. This key finding led to the development of the social identity perspective – a theory of intergroup behaviour which is highly influential in social psychology. However, the minimal group studies were only conducted in a two-group setting, reflecting a general emphasis on dichotomous intergroup settings in social psychology. Furthermore, the removal of interaction from the social setting, in the pursuit of experimental control, reflects a view of human beings as passive conformers rather than active agents in the development of social norms. The aim of this research was to extend the minimal group paradigm in order to study a multigroup setting that reaches beyond the two-group group paradigm that has dominated traditional research. In particular, the inclusion of a third group illuminated the role of a middle status group which has been largely ignored. Second, by allowing social interaction, which is usually excluded due to lack of experimental control, the role of human agency and creativity in the formation of norms could be studied. It was found that it was within the middle status group that the strength of ingroup bias begins to weaken as group members strategically attempt to manage their position in the middle. Furthermore, particular behavioural trends accelerated or decelerated over time as they gained or lost momentum. While ingroup bias slowed over time for the middle status group, outward giving to the high status group increased. This finding exemplifies the two-way interaction between the social environment and the social actors within this environment. Finally, an unexpected outcome of this research was the divergence between the psychological experience and social reality in such a way that an intergroup alliance between the low and high status group (when a middle status group was included) was reported when in fact the exact opposite was true.","2014","2022-10-05 00:10:46","2022-10-05 00:10:46","2022-10-05 00:10:46","","","","","","","Re-imagining possibilities for minimal groups","","","","","","","en_ZA","","Thesis","","","researchspace.ukzn.ac.za","","Accepted: 2015-08-05T13:34:02Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, it argues that Bonaventure’s doctrine of hierarchy became increasingly informed by his devotion to Francis’ virtues and to Christ’ Crucified, so that, by the time he wrote the Legenda maior sancti Francisci (by 1263) hierarchy was Franciscanized by an explicit integration with the Cross, the spiritual senses of scripture, and the primacy of love in union to God. Simultaneously, this dissertation argues that Bonaventure’s interpretation of St. Francis’ spiritual significance employed the structures of Dionysian hierarchy: the active and passive use of the hierarchical powers and the understanding of holiness as the assimilation to the angels and the imitation of God’s saving work. Finally, this dissertation argues that the Franciscanization of hierarchy entailed, paradoxically, both divergences from and convergence with the Dionysius’ original articulation of hierarchy. They diverge, in as much as Bonaventure’s interpretation of St. Francis’ through the lens of hierarchy sundered Dionysius’ yoking of spiritual maturity and ecclesiastical rank and appropriated aspects of Dionysius’ clergy, especially the hierarch or bishop, to Francis. On the other hand, in its Franciscanization, Bonaventure’s doctrine of hierarchy became increasingly Christocentric and attentive to the centrality of worship in the mediation of God’s presence, or influentia, to humans and angels and in this way enshrined and more closely resembled the original core of Dionysian hierarchy that the deifying descent of Jesus Christ, the light of God the Father, and the imitation thereof is the source of all ascent through hierarchy. In order to demonstrate these developments in Bonaventure’s thought, this dissertation explains the original sense of hierarchy in Dionysius’ thought and presents multiple medieval receptions of Dionysian hierarchy found in the 13th century Corpus Dionysiacum Parisiense in order to contrast and contextualize Bonaventure’s own doctrine of hierarchy and its development into the Legenda maior.","","2022-10-05 00:11:58","2022-10-05 00:11:58","2022-10-05 00:11:57","","509","","","","","A Sweet Influence","","","","","Marquette University","United States -- Wisconsin","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781392079072","","","","","Social sciences; Hierarchy; Angels; Bonaventure; Cult; Dionysius; Francis; Philosophy; religion and theology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"S5IIAU5Q","thesis","2015","Truesdale, Mark David","Mingling kings and clowns: carnivalesque politics of the fifteenth-century King and Commoner tradition","","","","","https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/82347/","This thesis analyses the political ideologies of the fifteenth-century King and Commoner tradition. This critically neglected yet widespread tradition occupied a unique political and cultural space in the literature of the later Middle Ages, leaving an indelible mark on British culture. Its influence and study impacts on outlaw literature, romance, and Shakespearean drama. This thesis provides the first detailed critical history and close textual analysis of the King and Commoner tradition as a whole. Drawing on Bakhtinian and Foucauldian methodologies, it examines this material’s amalgamation of carnival rituals with late-medieval complaint literature and insurgent demands. The Introduction traces King and Commoner analogues across other cultures, insular romance and chronicles. Chapter One focuses on King Edward and the Shepherd (c. 1400), arguing that this ‘bourde’ utilises the commoner’s carnivalesque poached feast and anti-noble complaints to invert social norms and deconstruct hierarchical boundaries. The King emerges here as a proto-panoptical spy, while the court is identified with corruption, oppression and alterity amid the commoner’s containment. Chapter Two explores this carnival inversion in John the Reeve (c. 1450), arguing that this text repeatedly stages a carnivalesque violence directed at the social body, culminating in John’s insurgent storming of the court. Chapter Three focuses on Rauf Coilȝear (c. 1460) and A Gest of Robyn Hode (c. 1500), contending that the tradition’s carnivalesque elements allow it to interact with both the worlds of Carolingian romance and outlaw literature in these hybrid texts. Chapter Four examines the King and Commoner ballads and chapbooks of the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, arguing that this conservative, pro-monarchic material self-consciously contains and remediates the tradition. The Appendix to Chapter Four also identifies King and Commoner influenced drama from the sixteenth century onwards, highlighting the tradition’s absorption into an array of cultural narratives, from Robin Hood plays to national histories.","2015","2022-10-05 02:33:26","2022-10-05 02:33:26","2022-10-05 02:33:26","","299","","","","","Mingling kings and clowns","","","","","Cardiff University","","en","","phd","","","orca.cardiff.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This became evident because of the ways in which the South African state was integrated back into the international economy through adopting neoliberal economic policies. This included a free-market economy with no state intervention, trade liberalisation through the lowering of barriers for foreign investment, and liberalisation of the media complex which was tightly controlled by the state. These were prescribed as an effective way of consolidating the new fragile democratic South Africa thereby seeing the new government accepting a neoliberal policy path. This was part of the embrace of the new won democracy and relationship with the international community after many years of economic sanctioning, political isolation and pariah status. The aim of this study is to examine the ways in which South African print media reproduce the dominance of neo-liberal discourses by globalising South Africa from outside and within. In addition, this study specifically seeks to look at how South Africa’s print media legitimises and authorises macro-economic policy. Thus, entrenching the ideas of a neo-liberal stance as well as analysing the perceptions of the print media’s class orientation in relation to the ruling historic bloc. The historic bloc is all levels of society [political, social, civil] coming together to form a dominant social class. This study will make use of interviews transcripts from 7 audio recorded and one email interview as well as the Business Day and Mail & Guardian’s reports on the Budget Speech from 2011-2014. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Country Reports on South Africa were also used as data, and also analysed during the same period. These will be used to analyse how these newspapers report on macro-economic issues through the abovementioned case studies. This study employed the mixed research method which uses quantitative and qualitative tools to analyse the data which is a convergent design also known as triangulation. The quantitative tool used was content analysis for its numerical value and the qualitative tool used was the thematic analysis which is an inductive reading of the reports and transcripts. These tools exposed interesting results which echoed historical trends of ownership, values and norms illustrating an important but narrow function of the selected newspapers.","2015-08-25","2022-10-05 02:33:54","2022-10-05 02:33:54","2022-10-05 02:33:54","","","","","","","How the print media globalises South Africa from outside and within","","","","","","","en","","Thesis","","","wiredspace.wits.ac.za","","Accepted: 2015-08-25T14:10:37Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"WJCXKZVS","thesis","2004","Turkett, William H.","Robust multiagent plan generation and execution with decision theoretic planners","","","","","","This thesis details research concerning the development of multiagent systems that can support robust goal achievement in realistic environments. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are the de-facto technique for modeling environments with uncertainty. Traditional approaches to finding optimal policies for POMDPs are unable to scale to problems with more than tens of states. In many POMDP domains there is significant structure which, if exploited, can significantly reduce the computational requirements for generating policies. Run-time knowledge can also be used to further reduce computational requirements during policy generation. The main hypothesis of this research is that the exploitation of structure and runtime knowledge in the use of dynamic decision networks for POMDP planning will scale better than existing POMDP algorithms for policy generation, while still supporting generation of high quality policies. The scalability of algorithms which exploit domain structure and run-time knowledge in POMDPs is demonstrated by comparison to current exact and approximate approaches for finding POMDP solutions. To support social-level goals in a distributed environment, researchers have developed POMDP models encompassing multiagent beliefs and actions. These models are extremely computationally complex. Other popular approaches for supporting social goal achievement either do not fit well within frameworks for reasoning under uncertainty or do not balance individual and social goals well. A second hypothesis of this work is that socially-driven utility functions can be defined within a MDP framework and that agents planning with such a utility function can effectively balance social and individual goals while performing localized decision-theoretic planning. The performance of multiagent systems using a socially-driven utility function is compared to the performance of systems acting under alternative approaches to multiagent planning and execution.","2004","2022-10-05 02:34:46","2022-10-05 02:34:46","","","190","","","","","","","","","","University of South Carolina","USA","","","phd","","","ACM Digital Library","","AAI3142863 ISBN-10: 0496007254","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The soldiers of the companies were divided in their loyalty by the Pamlico Sound and the role of slavery within the communities on the mainland and Outer Banks of Hyde County. As a result of these divisions, mainlanders with close ties to slavery filled the ranks of the Confederate company, while Outer Banks men with little connection to slavery enlisted in the Union company. Using quantitative and qualitative methods to examine loyalty in eastern North Carolina’s coastal plain and Outer Banks reveals that the soldiers of Hyde County were divided in loyalty by their relationships to slavery and racial hierarchy but motivated throughout the war by additional demographic factors and circumstances. The mainland Confederates and Banker Federals of Hyde County were divided in loyalty by differing connections to slavery, and their military service reflects the stark divide that existed between the mainland and Outer Banks societies of coastal North Carolina during the antebellum period and the Civil War.","2020","2022-10-05 02:35:13","2022-10-05 02:35:13","2022-10-05 02:35:13","","143","","","","","A Conflict of Interests","","","","","East Carolina University","United States -- North Carolina","English","Copyright ProQuest Dissertations Publishing 2020","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798582522690","","","","","Hyde County; North Carolina; Outer Banks; Racial hierarchy; Slavery; Soliders; State Troops; Union","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such documents are increasingly important in defining, and potentially undermining, the professional status of specialist TESOL knowledge and roles in schools. Part of the influence of teacher standards is through policy transfer, and the examples analysed here were selected for their status as models for the drafters of an emerging policy framework in Victoria, Australia. Building on an emerging theoretical tradition focused on pedagogical content knowledge, the analysis identifies contrasting paradigms of teacher expertise that vary in depth and relative importance attributed to knowledge of language. The authors argue that the differing constructions of pedagogical content knowledge across jurisdictions imply different kinds of teacher roles that are potentially in tension. The three kinds of positioning that the authors identify are generalist teacher of language and literacy, teacher as TESOL specialist, and teacher of emerging bi/multilinguals. The analysis suggests that greater attention should be given to how teacher knowledge is framed in educational policy, with regard for coherence, practicability, and broader professional expectations.","2019","2022-10-05 02:35:22","2022-10-05 02:35:22","2022-10-05 02:35:22","939-959","","4","53","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/tesq.527","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to increasingly intense intercultural and transnational movements, national educational systems face new challenges in negotiating with the multitude of civic identities and memberships, those being also related to religions and worldviews. The purpose of this volume is to enrich and complement the discussion concerning religion in education by contextualising the respective phenomena in the current Finnish educational policy and practice, as well as by drawing together empirical and theoretical observations from several case analyses. Even though international comparative studies are integral for the development of knowledge on religion and education, this localised approach concentrating on the Finnish education system provides an interesting case for the analysis in many ways: The Finnish society is rather slowly becoming diverse and plural, whereas the processes of secularisation have recently been quite rapid. The volume at hand discusses how these changes of secularisation and pluralisation in a religious landscape create new conditions for understanding educational dialogue amidst diversity.","2019","2022-10-05 02:35:30","2022-10-05 02:35:30","","","230","","","","","Contextualising dialogue, secularisation and pluralism","","","","","Waxmann Verlag","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: meCaDwAAQBAJ","","","https://www.google.com/books?id=meCaDwAAQBAJ","","Education / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the framework of the multilevel methodology (group-level fixed-effects logit multilevel models), the analysis also compared the effects of distinct profiles of gender dynamics with effects of various aspects of female status. The cross-cultural data used in statistical analyses came from DHS surveys conducted in 13 sub-Saharan countries. The two core hypotheses of this gender context hypothesis are supported. While the adoption of modern contraception is greater among settings in which the prevalence of advanced female education is higher, it is substantially discouraged within the boundaries of communities in which age differences between the spouses are wide and disempowering for women. Moreover, the fact that fertility desires are strong among women living in these gender stratified and male-dominated societies suggests that traditional pronatalism is fostered and perpetuated by cultural systems that are inegalitarian (with respect to gender) and unfavorable to women. Above and beyond context differences in fertility choices, there are variations among individual women. Individual characteristics that are both disempowering and channels through which the adoption of modern family planning is discouraged are unbalanced forms of marital relations indexed by variables spousal age gap and spousal education gap. On the other hand, female status attributes that are both empowering and associated with more modern fertility outcomes are wife's education, husband's education, and husband's occupation in the modern economy. Overall, the importance of seeing variations in fertility behavior as a multilevel process that occurs at both the individual and societal levels is strongly supported. while macro-level fertility research is incomplete because it fails to account for individual heterogeneity in fertility choices, micro-level studies are also incomplete because they do not provide a clear indication of how contextual variations in gender conditions affect fertility decisions. Only multilevel studies have the ability to identify the determinants of fertility behavior across a region as diverse as Africa south of the Sahara because they can fully accommodate the complexity and the multilayered nature of those determinants.","","2022-10-05 02:36:00","2022-10-05 02:36:00","2022-10-05 02:36:00","","227","","","","","","","","","","Cornell University","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780599427174","","","","","Social sciences; Africa; Gender; Fertility behavior; Sub-Saharan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For general communities, epidemic modeling based on social networks is being recognized as a useful tool. However, disease propagation may occur in a healthcare facility in a manner different from that in a urban community setting due to different network architecture. We simulate stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered dynamics on social networks, which are based on observations in a hospital in Tokyo, to explore effective containment strategies against nosocomial infection. The observed social networks in the hospital have hierarchical and modular structure in which dense substructure such as departments, wards, and rooms, are globally but only loosely connected, and do not reveal extremely right-skewed distributions of the number of contacts per individual. We show that healthcare workers, particularly medical doctors, are main vectors (i.e. transmitters) of diseases on these networks. Intervention methods that restrict interaction between medical doctors and their visits to different wards shrink the final epidemic size more than intervention methods that directly protect patients, such as isolating patients in single rooms. By the same token, vaccinating doctors with priority rather than patients or nurses is more effective. Finally, vaccinating individuals with large betweenness centrality (frequency of mediating connection between pairs of individuals along the shortest paths) is superior to vaccinating ones with large connectedness to others or randomly chosen individuals, which was suggested by previous model studies.","2008-10-07","2022-10-05 02:36:06","2022-10-05 02:36:06","2022-10-05 02:36:06","655-666","","3","254","","Journal of Theoretical Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Complex networks; Healthcare worker; SIR model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ancient P’urépecha cities were the urban component of a larger polity known as an Ireta. These were territorial polities that were similar to the Aztec altepetl, and might be considered analogous to a “city-state.” Each Ireta could be divided into a series of nested territorial units. Larger units, the uapátzequecha, consisted of neighborhoods within cities and towns or villages in the countryside. Beneath these were smaller groupings of households that formed the basis of the ocámbecha tax system used by the Kingdom of Tzintzuntzan, the empire which dominated the region during the Late Postclassic Period (c. 1350 – 1530 AD).   Small architectural complexes (complejos) at the archaeological site of Angamuco, Michoacan, Mexico approximately match the size of the unit that the ocámbecha administered. This study maps these units using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA). The results of this modeling produce a map of complejos that approximately matches hypothesized territorial divisions at the site. While more research is needed, the current evidence suggests that the territorial divisions which formed the basis of the ocámbecha tax system may predate the Late Postclassic empire. This could indicate that the empire simply co-opted existing territorial divisions for tax collection rather than creating new ones.","2014-12-31","2022-10-05 02:38:42","2022-10-05 02:38:42","2022-10-05 02:38:42","","","","","","","Ireta, The","","","","","Colorado State University","","eng","Copyright of the original work is retained by the author.","Text","","","mountainscholar.org","","Accepted: 2015-08-28T14:35:33Z Artwork Medium: born digital Interview Medium: born digital","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Iran was a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. While there were other proliferation cases by states not party to the NPT, Iranian issue became the center of international concern. Despite incentives and sanctions by the international community, Iran did not suspend its nuclear program. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to explain why the international community is especially concerned about the Iranian nuclear program and why Iran is so insistent on its nuclear program. This study has adopted the power transition theory perspective to analyze the Iranian nuclear issue with reference to the change in Middle Eastern power balances in the post-9/11 period. The fall of Iraq in 2003 has created a power vacuum in the Middle East. Given its high GDP levels, big population, and oil-rich territory, Iran regards itself as the potential power to fill this power vacuum. The USA has established a status-quo in the region, which serves its regional interests. The rise of Iran might mean a challenge to US interests in the region. An analysis of domestic systems differences, dissatisfaction with the international norms, membership to international and regional organizations not dominated by the USA and missile build-up has shown that Iran is dissatisfied with the US led status-quo. The nuclear program serves as a tool for Iran to challenge the US-led status-quo and become a leading regional power.","2011","2022-10-05 02:38:49","2022-10-05 02:38:49","2022-10-05 02:38:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","Thesis","","","research.sabanciuniv.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By studying several websites and weblogs that have a religious orientation, different layers of religious authority including “religious hierarchy, structures, ideology, and sources” (Campbell, 2009) can be identified. Also, using Weber’s definition of the three types of authority, “rational-legal, traditional, and charismatic” (1968), the specific type of authority that is being presented on blogosphere can be recognized.   The Internet presents a level of liberty for the discussion of sensitive topics in any kind of religious cyberspace, specifically the Islamic one. In this way, the Internet is expanding the number and range of Muslim voices, which may pose problems for traditional forms of religious authority or may suggest new forms of authority in the Islamic world. The interaction between the Internet and religion is often perceived as contradictory, especially when it is religion at its most conservative practice. While the international and national applications of the Internet have increased vastly, local religious communities, especially fundamentalists, perceived this new technology as a threat to their local cultures and practices.   If we look at the Internet as a central phenomenon of contemporary modernity that interacts with practiced fundamentalist religious traditions, we can ask how broad the interactions are between religious fundamentalism and the Internet and whether these relations can be reconciled. More specifically, this thesis presents a study of the junction of the Internet and religious fundamentalism reviewing the presentation of Shiite religious authority on the Persian blogosphere.   As a case study, Persian weblogs are studied for content analysis for this thesis. Weblogs’ texts are analyzed to find evidences for Shiite beliefs and shared identity, usages and interpretations of the main Shiite religious texts, references to the role of recognized Shiite leaders, and descriptions of Shiite structural patterns of practices and organizations.   This research will demonstrate how the Internet has been culturally constructed, modified, and adapted to the Iranian community’s needs and how the Shiite fundamentalist community of Iran has been affected by it. Based on one of the most structured research in this area, the study by Baezilai-Nahon and Barzilai (2005), in this article I identify four principal dimensions of religious fundamentalism as they interact with the Internet: hierarchy, patriarchy, discipline, and seclusion.","2012-05-23","2022-10-05 02:41:11","2022-10-05 02:41:11","2022-10-05 02:41:11","","","","","","","Manifestation of Religious Authority on the Internet","","","","","University of Waterloo","","en","","Master Thesis","","","uwspace.uwaterloo.ca","","Accepted: 2012-05-23T17:46:02Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relation between promotion, pay, and employee performance is analyzed to assess the extent to which earnings growth is influenced by administrative pay rules, human capital accumulation, and employee performance. Promotions are defined by movement through a job grade structure, and initial job grade depends on individual employee characteristics such as education and experience, not job title. The job grade structure is endogenous, insofar as the firm adjusts its promotion rates out of job grades to achieve a desired salary distribution. Promotion has a sizeable positive effect on earnings growth, and a fast track exists. However, prior earnings increases within grade do not forecast promotions, suggesting the presence of an administrative policy to limit pay dispersion among employees in the same grade. The covariance structure of earnings growth in the firm is modeled to test the hypothesis of individual-specific career earnings paths. I identify a permanent component in earnings growth which is economically significant. In contrast to most previous findings, there is both positive serial correlation and long-term persistence in earnings growth for the firm's professional and managerial employees. A prominent feature of the firm's pay policy--rent-sharing--has a significant impact on the level of persistence in earnings growth. Finally, the relation between the internal labor market of the firm and the external labor market is analyzed. Changes in the firm's wage structure generally replicate changes observed in the aggregate labor market in the 1980s and early 1990s. In particular, beginning in the mid-1980s, both education and occupation earnings differentials began to widen considerably in the firm. However, in contrast to a rising experience premium in the U.S. labor market, the experience premium for professionals in this firm was declining in the 1990s. The evidence suggests that a primary source of increasing wage inequality in the firm has been skill-biased technological change which has increased the demand for skilled professionals.","","2022-10-05 02:41:40","2022-10-05 02:41:40","2022-10-05 02:41:40","","159","","","","","The employment relation in a technology-intensive firm","","","","","University of California, Berkeley","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780591993691","","","","","Social sciences; Governance; Incentives; Technology-intensive firm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many children are exposed to the distress related to it. In South Africa, the Children’s Act 38 of 2005 section 33(1) attempts to implement a model for co-parenting with parenting plans that describe how the parents will contribute to the care and well-being of their child or children. Although parenting plans are included in mediation processes, the implementation thereof is not always successful and in the best interests of the children involved. In this research study, the researcher aimed to explore divorced parents’ experiences of factors that influence the implementation of the parenting plans. The views of professionals involved in intervention with divorce regarding the factors that influence the implementation of parenting plans, were also explored.  The theoretical framework for this study was the Ecological Systems Theory and the Family Systems Theory. This study mixed different research methods to analyse and interpret research results obtained from a representative sample. This was achieved through the use and integration of data in the various research stages namely data collection, data analysis and discussion and reporting of findings. The qualitative data was collected and analysed to determine factors influencing the use of parenting plans during and after divorce. Qualitative data was gathered through interviews with parents who made use of a parenting plan to assist them with the transition of being an intact family to a divorced family. Interviews were conducted with 40 parents. The quantitative phase consisted of a questionnaire for a sample of 100 professionals who met the sample criteria. The questionnaire was hand delivered to the nearby respondents and emailed to the others. After the researcher explored the participants’ personal experiences, the professionals’ opinion and the literature review were completed, conclusions were drawn, and recommendations were made. The researcher concluded that all family members should be involved in drafting a parenting plan. A parenting plan assists parents in making correct choices for their children and fosters relationships between parents and children. It provides structure, eliminates conflict and protects all members included. Not all professionals who draft parenting plans have adequate training and experience. Most professionals deem that the writing of parenting plans should be a specialised field in practice. In comparing this statement with feedback from the parents who were interviewed, specialised intervention and assistance regarding parenting plans are prioritised. Guidelines for the implementation of parenting plans for parents and professionals were developed.","2018","2022-10-05 02:41:50","2022-10-05 02:41:50","2022-10-05 02:41:50","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Pretoria","","en","© 2018 University of Pretoria.

It concentrates on a cycle of contention extending over several months in 1569, including a labour protest that started among the workers of the state shipyard and turned into a large revolt, anonymous placards and food riots. Such was the extent of the unrest that a major explosion in the shipyard raised suspicion of sabotage. Eventually, the government had to capitulate to the workers’ demands. This cycle of protests in Venice, a city normally renowned for peace and concord, has left minimal traces in the official records: the government tried to suppress the protests not only in practice but also on paper. It carried out convictions in secret, obliterated the revolt from its archives, buried any mention of protest under countless other records, and elided dissent from published histories. By using a variety of non-governmental sources, it is possible to investigate how contentious politics were written out of government records, and hence of history. Manipulating archives was always easier than subduing people: the more power was contested in the streets, the more it needed to be asserted in the archive.","2022-02-19","2022-10-05 02:46:12","2022-10-05 02:46:12","2022-10-05 02:46:12","gtab040","","","","","Past & Present","Papering Over Protest","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The essay analyzes how Arenas's novels expand upon and engage in a critical dialogue from ""within"" this popular narrative form, which explores more the areas of history than of fiction. It is argued how the pentagonía gives voice to those members of Cuban revolutionary society—dissidents, ""extravagants,"" dreamers, freethinkers, homosexuals—who have been forgotten, silenced, and overlooked by the official discourse of power while, at the same time, underscoring how fiction can indeed express much more than overt and unmistakable political messages.

"JUVDYWK5","thesis","2019","Spanke, Till","Nurturing dependence: the role of patron states in the state and institution building processes of de facto states","","","","","https://etheses.lse.ac.uk/4131/","De facto states are not the likeliest candidates for state building, due to their limited financial capabilities and external parent state pressures. While some de facto states built relatively stable state structures without an external patron state (e.g. Somaliland), others are largely dependent on the backing of patrons to provide basic public services and goods (e.g. Northern Cyprus). This thesis uncovers the extent to which patron states influence state and institution building efforts of de facto states. A case study of Russian involvement in Abkhazia’s state building pursuits complements statistical analyses of a data set of 34 de facto states between 1945 and 2011. This thesis argues that patrons nurture the dependence of de facto states on patron support by pursuing a multi-layered policy of granting de facto state agency in an international setting of limited alternatives and providing aid that discourages self-sufficiency. Patrons support de facto states in guaranteeing minimal civilian governance to ensure a degree of sustainability and internal legitimacy. Patrons provide little state building assistance beyond this stage to ensure the status quo of dependence. Russia, for instance, concentrates on infrastructural reconstruction rather than capacity development in Abkhazia and takes on government responsibilities from the de facto authorities. By distinguishing between direct and indirect diffusion influences of patrons, this thesis clarifies why Abkhaz elites adjusted their actions according to perceived Russian interests and activities even during Abkhazia’s period of partial isolation. Due to the limited availability of viable alternative choices, de facto regimes are less likely to resist coercive influences and more susceptible to indirect diffusion influences. The agency of dependent de facto states is therefore bound by patron interests and activities, which encourages legislative and institutional isomorphism. Despite limited room for manoeuvre, Abkhazia has repeatedly displayed agency in the fields of language and private property policies.","2019-09","2022-10-05 02:48:09","2022-10-05 02:48:09","2022-10-05 02:48:09","","369","","","","","Nurturing dependence","","","","","London School of Economics and Political Science","","en","","phd","","","etheses.lse.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Sub-Saharan Africa, rebels commonly use organized violence to challenge the authority of pre-conflict elites. Nonetheless, armed movements also ally with pre-conflict elite actors as a strategy for mobilizing popular support and maintaining political order. Contestation and cooperation between rebels and pre-conflict elites is possible because local communities are often comprised of multiple elite groups. What explains coalitional choices? Why do local leaders of armed movements ally with certain actors and not others? These questions are puzzling because local-level rebel leaders sometimes make counterintuitive coalitional choices that restrict their ability to establish and maintain social control.  To explore the relationship between coalition-building and control, this study focuses on the political crisis and war-to-peace transition in Côte d’Ivoire (2002-2013). It compares three towns – Bouna, Korhogo and Ouangolodougou – that fell under the military control of the principal armed movement involved in the conflict, the Forces Nouvelles (FN). Despite being under the control of the same group, each of these cases demonstrated marked variation in the ability of the FN to politically control local populations. My argument is advanced in two steps. First, what explains patterns of coalition-building in rebel-held zones? I argue that coalition-building is shaped by pre-conflict brokerage relations. Brokers are those political actors that link local communities to the state. I argue that if elites function as brokers between local communities and the central state in the pre-conflict period, this limits their availability as potential allies for leaders of armed movements. Pre-conflict brokerage relations constrain the choice of potential local partners. Second and relatedly, this study explains levels of control established by armed movements that result from coalition-building. The wartime authority of armed movements can, in some cases, be met with stiff resistance from local actors. In others, the wartime political order imposed by armed movements is underwritten by broad support within local communities. I explain these differences by focusing on what I call ‘hierarchical configurations’. Hierarchical configurations describe the relative levels of social hierarchy of competing elite groups. I argue that the level of wartime control established by armed movements is a function of variation in hierarchical configurations because these differences influence the political clout of rebel allies relative to their broker counterparts (or those elites aligned with the state). In summary, pre-conflict brokerage relations influence the coalition-building strategies of armed groups. These coalition-building strategies shape levels of contestation and rebel control as a result of variation in local-level hierarchical configurations.","2015-08","2022-10-05 02:48:17","2022-10-05 02:48:17","2022-10-05 02:48:17","","253","","","","","","","","","","Concordia University","","en","","phd","","","spectrum.library.concordia.ca","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study sought to examine the relationship of perceived bureaucratization and attitudinal professionalism to organizational climate in one type of organization, the public schools. Specifically, the study sought to address two research questions: first, how does the degree of bureaucratization of an organization relate to the openness of climate in the organization; second, how does the degree of attitudinal professionalism in an organization relate to the openness of organizational climate. Bureaucracy was defined in terms of selected component dimension of the ""pure-type"" bureaucracy as theorized by Weber, including: hierarchy of authority, rules and regulations, and impersonality. Professionalism was defined in terms of attitudinal dimensions of professionalism, including: autonomy from clients, autonomy from the employing organization, and altruism. Data were collected from superintendents, principals, and teachers in 10 school systems chosen randomly from among all school systems in Oklahoma with an Average Daily Attendance of 2,000 or more students. The research questions were answered by testing hypotheses with the Pearson product-moment correlation technique. Findings and Conclusions. The data analysis revealed that bureaucracy and its characteristic dimensions were positively related to openness of climate rather than negatively related as hypothesized. Professionalism and its characteristic dimensions were found to correlate positively with openness of climate, as hypothesized, although the relationship was not significant. Additional analysis was made of the relationship of the bureaucratic dimensions to the professionalism dimensions. The results showed a tendency among teachers for autonomy from client influence to increase as bureaucracy increases. Teacher responses also seemed to indicate a tendency for autonomy from organizational influence to decrease as the rules and regulations dimension of bureaucracy increases. The findings led to the conclusion that educators either desire some structure within which to carry on the work of the profession or perceive climate differently, depending upon their position in the organization's hierarchy.","","2022-10-05 02:48:35","2022-10-05 02:48:35","2022-10-05 02:48:35","","156","","","","","","","","","","Oklahoma State University","United States -- Oklahoma","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Educat.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781082686139","","","","","Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It concerns the development of an ""educative politics"" which is seen as a response by ""advanced liberals"" to a mounting sense of political and cultural insecurity. It grounds this response in an ambivalence which lies at the conceptual and existential heart of liberalism and links its elaboration to the reception of essentially conservative social theories from the Continent, notably French Positivism. The need to integrate the working class into society, while at the same time preserving established institutions, issued in two related varieties of educative politics. The first, more optimistic version sought the rational society through the creation of the rational individual. However, as the threat of democracy loomed larger a more ""defensive"" move held to the importance of strongly grounded feelings and beliefs. Education became very much bound up with the organization of public opinion through which it exercised a ""restraining discipline"", a ""moral force."" Both responses articulated new directions in social organization with the guiding role of an educated elite. The essence of educative politics was crystallized by J. S. Mill in his thoroughly Comtean recommendation of a state in which the uninstructed shall defer to the authority of the instructed in politics and morals just as they do in the physical sciences. This idea, and others associated with it, is viewed as having exerted a powerful influence on reformist thinking in education from Mill through to the Fabians.","","2022-10-05 02:48:46","2022-10-05 02:48:46","2022-10-05 02:48:46","","315","","","","","Social Theory and Educational Reform in Victorian England","","","","","State University of New York at Buffalo","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798204895744","","","","","Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides using vehicles of their fleets, there are different outsourcing options offered by logistics service providers, but these are much more expensive. The decision-making kernel of the decision support system is implemented as a multi-agent-system (MAS). The kernel provides a distributed hierarchical algorithm for cooperative transportation planning and an on-line data layer that contains all the information for decision making. We sketch the distributed hierarchical transportation planning algorithm and identity the required software agents. The MAS interacts via web services with a commercial tour planning system that persistently stores the resulting tour plans, orders, and customer data. Moreover, the tour planning system is used to offer graphical user interfaces to interact with the users. The data layer is updated by order and customer data from the ERP systems of the different manufacturing companies. We describe the architecture and the implementation of the MAS and the overall coupling framework. Furthermore, we discuss the simulation-based performance assessment of the resulting decision support system when the system is applied in a rolling horizon setting and present some computational results.

A study of the public and private activities of the Academy, it grants insight into the revolutionary education of both the academicians and their public. It seeks to understand the process whereby those without legitimate political voice considered themselves summoned by this academy to express their views and then analyzes the texts which were for many a first written formulation of political opinion. It surveys the Academy's success in attracting public interest in its competitions and shows how this proved prejudicial to its survival and that of the reforms its essay contests had been designed to support. The Chalons contests provoked essays from across the social and geographic spectrum. They constitute a significant sample of literate opinion on the eve of the Revolution and provide, along with the Academy's correspondence with Crown ministers, 14,000 pages of primary source material for this study. Chapter one sets the context with an overview of French academies and the Crown's intentions in founding them. Chapter two surveys the Chalons Academy's history and its relationship to the movement for reform. Chapter three profiles its essay competitors; chapters four and five analyze its competition essays on the begging and labouring poor. Chapter six summarizes the reception given its contests by the public and government and considers their response to the questions announced after the first contest. Chapter seven recounts the government's censorship of the Academy's activities and the response it evoked.

For the purpose of this project, the term ethos describes the atmosphere or culture in which decisions are made within an organization. The current conversation concerning decision-making ethos in the church tends to juxtapose hierarchical and collaborative structures and prioritize one over the other. This project hopes to suggest that there exists a third way of organizational decision making that is best described by the term collaborative hierarchy. Collaborative hierarchy provides clarity concerning the ultimate ownership of a decision based on positional authority within the hierarchy but encourages the decision-maker to invite others into the conversation, regardless of position in the hierarchy, for the purpose of making the best decision possible. Surveys were given to the staff of six congregations that have experienced an average annual growth rate in weekend worship services of at least 10 percent year over a period of ten years. The surveys measured the degree to which the decision-making ethos of each staff member's particular congregation is hierarchical and the degree to which it is collaborative. In addition, the senior pastor of each of the six churches surveyed, with the exception of the author, completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The findings of the surveys revealed that all the congregations surveyed for this project possessed a decision-making ethos that reflected collaborative hierarchy. The results did not seem to be significantly impacted by the gender or age of the respondents. Additionally, a brief review of key biblical passages pertaining both to Old Testament Israel and the New Testament church offer examples of a decision-making ethos that are consistent with collaborative hierarchy. This project concludes that a decision-making ethos that reflects collaborative hierarchy offers a worthy alternative to rigid hierarchical structures or purely collaborative systems. The results of the surveys and interviews utilized in the project reinforce this conclusion. The project recommends that congregations examine their own decision-making ethos in an effort to determine if the way they make decisions negatively impacts missional success.","","2022-10-05 02:49:37","2022-10-05 02:49:37","2022-10-05 02:49:37","","161","","","","","","","","","","Anderson University","United States -- Indiana","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","D.Min.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781124624785","","","","","Leadership; Social sciences; Decision-making; Management; Philosophy; religion and theology; Church growth; Church polity; Organization theory; Urban churches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dionysius draws on the Platonic and Philonic taxonomies of madness and ecstasy, but complements and corrects this philosophical inheritance by appeal to Paul. The chapter concludes by returning to the definition of hierarchy with which Chapter Three begins and arguing that the second element of that definition—hierarchy as a “state of understanding” (epistēmē)—must be understood as a play on words, that through hierarchy we can enjoy an ecstatic epistēmē, that is, an under‐standing predicated precisely on standing‐outside ourselves.","2012-02-09","2022-10-05 02:51:10","2022-10-05 02:51:10","2022-10-05 02:51:09","0","","","","","","“No Longer I”","","","","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","","Silverchair","","DOI: 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199640423.003.0006","","","","","","Stang, Charles M.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is free to read at Oxford Scholarship Online and offered as a free PDF download from OUP and selected open access locations. This book examines the writings of an early sixth-century Christian mystical theologian who wrote under the name of a convert of the apostle Paul, Dionysius the Areopagite. This 'Pseudo'-Dionysius is famous for articulating a mystical theology in two parts: a sacramental and liturgical mysticism embedded in the context of celestial and ecclesiastical hierarchies, and an austere, contemplative regimen in which one progressively negates the divine names in hopes of soliciting union with the 'unknown God' or 'God beyond being.' Charles M. Stang argues that the pseudonym and the influence of Paul together constitute the best interpretive lens for understanding the Corpus Dionysiacum [CD]. Stang demonstrates how Paul animates the entire corpus, and shows that the influence of Paul illuminates such central themes of the CD as hierarchy, theurgy, deification, Christology, affirmation (kataphasis) and negation (apophasis), dissimilar similarities, and unknowing. Most importantly, Paul serves as a fulcrum for the expression of a new theological anthropology, an 'apophatic anthropology.' Dionysius figures Paul as the premier apostolic witness to this apophatic anthropology, as the ecstatic lover of the divine who confesses to the rupture of his self and the indwelling of the divine in Gal 2:20: 'it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.' Building on this notion of apophatic anthropology, the book forwards an explanation for why this sixth-century author chose to write under an apostolic pseudonym. Stang argues that the very practice of pseudonymous writing itself serves as an ecstatic devotional exercise whereby the writer becomes split in two and thereby open to the indwelling of the divine. Pseudonymity is on this interpretation integral and internal to the aims of the wider mystical enterprise. Thus this book aims to question the distinction between 'theory' and 'practice' by demonstrating that negative theology-often figured as a speculative and rarefied theory regarding the transcendence of God-is in fact best understood as a kind of asceticism, a devotional practice aiming for the total transformation of the Christian subject.","2012-02-09","2022-10-05 02:52:48","2022-10-05 02:52:48","","","245","","","","","Apophasis and Pseudonymity in Dionysius the Areopagite","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: jx10DwAAQBAJ","","","https://www.google.com/books?id=jx10DwAAQBAJ","","Religion / Christianity / History; Religion / Biblical Studies / Exegesis & Hermeneutics; Religion / Christian Church / History; Religion / Christian Theology / General; Religion / Mysticism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We build on Gruen’s (2015) notion of ‘entangled empathy’ as a critical pathway for realising more-than-human cities. Critical theory, frameworks and methods work to challenge anthropocentrism, shifting the boundaries used to define the Anthropos, and decentring homo urbanis as the defining reference point for ethical action. Drawing on assemblage-methods around diagramming and sketching we outline a more-than-human urban politics. In the urban archipelagos of the Anthropocene, ‘where the wild things are’ is a shared habitat called the city. As conceptual signifiers, we argue both stray and friend offer examples of new relational possibilities of a more-than human politics for cities that currently exist, and for those yet to come.","2019-11-01","2022-10-05 02:53:00","2022-10-05 02:53:00","2022-10-05 02:53:00","411-415","","","106","","Geoforum","More-than-human cities","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Cities; Anthropocene; Assemblage methods; More-than-human","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, by focusing on the competitive environment in which companies operate, it abstracts from the cultural context in which governance decisions are made. We study the cultural boundedness of TCE using two seminal cultural theories: the political science/sociology framework of Inglehart and the management science framework of Hofstede. We use these theories to develop (main-effect) hypotheses about the cultural contexts in which TCE has higher predictive power as well as (interaction) hypotheses regarding particular cultural contexts that may inherently be more inclined than others to adopt certain non-market governance modes if the market “fails.” Hypotheses are tested using a meta-analysis on data collected from 128 studies from 12 countries on 3 continents, representing governance decisions of 60,926 companies. We find that TCE is a universal theory across all cultural contexts. This being said, we find that in societies low on power distance and in societies characterized by a strong emphasis on secular-rational and self-expression values, companies are more strongly guided in their governance decisions by economic, transaction-cost considerations than companies in societies high on power distance and in countries that are characterized by traditional and survival values. Further, TCE’s power to predict the specific type of non-market governance employed by the firm is systematically moderated by the national culture in which the firm operates. The power of TCE for predicting hierarchical governance is higher in countries that rate high on secular-rational values and on uncertainty avoidance and low on long-term orientation, whereas TCE is more diagnostic for predicting relational governance in countries high on self-expression values and low on power distance and on uncertainty avoidance. In sum, our meta-analysis provides support for our thesis that to fully understand governance choices made by firms, we need to integrate TCE and cultural theory. While managers around the world are guided by economic considerations, the cultural context in which they operate exerts a substantial—and predictable—contingent effect on their governance choices.","2012-03-01","2022-10-05 02:53:10","2022-10-05 02:53:10","2022-10-05 02:53:10","252-270","","2","40","","J. of the Acad.

Perceived dominance of the stimulus is operationally defined as the degree to which the  stimulus makes the recipient feel submissive (high) or powerful (low). The experimental  stimuli and the quantitative measurements of dominance are derived from affect control  theory and a research tool that has been developed from that theory, the International  Affective Picture System. The hypotheses were generally supported by the results of the data  analysis. Relationships were found between perceived dominance and a) increased opinion  agreement and b) increased trustworthiness of communicators.

If true, the rule of law ideal and the law's capacity to serve as an instrument of democratic reform are jeopardized. This dissertation extends legal domination scholarship by searching for legal domination evidence in the decision-making patterns of individual mock jurors. A series of randomly interchanged computer-simulated arguments juxtaposed the following messages: a meritoriously strong legal argument against a meritoriously weak legal argument; a meritoriously strong nonlegal argument against a meritoriously weak nonlegal argument; and a meritoriously strong nonlegal argument against a meritoriously weak legal argument. Aggregate results indicate that Incorrect Unquestioned Decision-Making (IUDM) frequencies are nearly twice as high (35.8%) among mock jurors who face competing legal and nonlegal arguments, as compared to IUDM frequencies among those facing two identically typed arguments (16.4%). Further analysis reveals that Caucasians (probability = 15.9%) are less amenable to IUDM expression than minorities (probability = 22.9%), while males (probability = 24.3%) are more amenable to IUDM expression than females (probability = 14.6%). While the data reveal a negative relationship between subjects' verdict confidence levels and their IUDM amenability, no directional trends prevailed between IUDM expression and subject income or socioeconomic status. The theoretical implications and limitations of this research are discussed.","","2022-10-05 03:17:15","2022-10-05 03:17:15","2022-10-05 03:17:15","","228","","","","","Searching for Legal Domination","","","","","Northwestern University","United States -- Illinois","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780599798748","","","","","Social sciences; Juror decision-making; Legal domination; Multimedia-based","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electroencephalography (EEG) data streams were collected from six crew members of a submarine piloting and navigation team while they performed a required training simulation. A representation of neurodynamic organization was first generated by creating symbols every second that showed the EEG power levels of each crew member. The second-by-second expression of these symbols continuously varied with the changing task, and the magnitude, duration and frequency of these variations could be quantitated using a moving window of Shannon entropy over the symbol stream. These changes in neurodynamic organization (i.e. entropy) were seen in the alpha, beta and gamma EEG frequency bands. A representation of team members' synchrony was created by measuring the mutual information in the EEG power levels for fourteen dyad combinations. Mutual information was present in the gamma EEG band, and elevated levels were distributed throughout the task. These discrete periods of synchrony were poorly correlated at zero lag with either changes in the team's neurodynamic organization, or speech patterns.","2016-04","2022-10-05 03:17:46","2022-10-05 03:17:46","","271-292","","2","20","","Nonlinear Dynamics Psychol Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27033135","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27033135","","Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Cooperative Behavior; Entropy; Individuality; Nonlinear Dynamics; Computer Simulation; Electroencephalography; Cerebral Cortex; Cortical Synchronization; Information Seeking Behavior; Information Services; Military Personnel; Work Performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"M62G3YBT","thesis","2020","Stockinger, Sarah A. E.","Governance and Management of German Universities","","","","","https://opus.bibliothek.uni-augsburg.de/opus4/frontdoor/index/index/docId/67944","What are the path dependencies of universities that shape our modern understanding? How can the performance of universities be influenced beneficially from an external governance and internal management perspective? In particular, how are policy and university structures affecting university performance? The underlying concepts of those questions are the interplay of management and governance, which are key elements of a Corporate Governance. In particular, governance can be seen as the construction of a proper institutional framework, which is dependent on external measures like policy initiatives as well as the design of institutions and their power (may this be boards, management, etc.) in terms of incentives and control. Management is, on the one side the “technical” design of a position comprising a complex of tasks and on the other side dependent on the staffing of this position with a proper person that is able and motivated to fulfill those tasks. A Corporate Governance frame is the interaction of both that are ideally coordinated prudently to ensure the desired conduct of the distinct purposes of universities: research and teaching by a set of selection, control and incentive mechanisms. This dissertation wants to answer the outlined questions by first tracing the roots and path dependencies of German universities in chapter two. The third chapter helps to understand determinants and theoretical underpinnings of governance and management, in general and in particular, in the German higher education system, comprising policy interventions, institutional mechanisms and individual leadership elements. In the fourth chapter, a sketching systematization of the German higher education system and the dataset is presented to show the current state and result of the dynamics that were outlined historically and theoretically in chapters two and three. This is followed by three empirical research projects:  First, the German Excellence Initiative – being a political governance instrument – gets evaluated. The analysis is tackling two questions: First, what was the impact of the Excellence Initiative on Excellence Universities as well as on the whole university system? Second, does a differentiation exist in terms of research quantity and research quality? The findings show that the Initiative was a role model in terms of research quantity – raising the quantitative output for the whole system and in particular for the winners – while it created a loosing winners effect in terms of research quality – raising the qualitative output for the system but decreasing it for the winners. Second, German university boards – being a control and power diffusion mechanism – are questioned in terms of whether and how they differ according to specific frameworks and competences. The testing of the difference hypotheses shows that the participation in deciding who is in the board as well as a president coming from outside or inside the university are related to the representation of societal, scientific or business members. Third, German university presidents – as personalities entering a management task – are researched. In particular, the research questions of (i) which personality traits influence to be perceived as leader (leadership emergence) and (ii) how leadership behavior contributes to be perceived as good leader (leadership effectiveness) are assessed. The results indicate that based on the Big 5 personality traits the only robust trait, which influences to be considered as a leader, is emotional stability. While considerable leadership behavior does not seem to influence leadership effectiveness, very low and very strong structure-giving behaviors are influencing it positively.","2020","2022-10-05 03:18:37","2022-10-05 03:18:44","2022-10-05 03:18:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","https://www.uni-augsburg.de/de/organisation/bibliothek/publizieren-zitieren-archivieren/publiz/","","","","opus.bibliothek.uni-augsburg.de","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Arnold et al. [Arnold III, P.J., Kneebone, R.R., Santley, R.S., Pool, C.A., 1993. Intensive ceramic production and Classic-period political economy in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. Ancient Mesoamerica 4(2), 175–191] have suggested that the specialized pottery production at Comoapan, the largest production locality at Matacapan, supplied the region with ceramics. This production locality overwhelmingly specialized in manufacturing Coarse Orange jars, which are found in many parts of the region. The current authors employed instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and petrographic point-counting analysis on Coarse Orange sherds sampled from 44 localities in the southwestern Tuxtlas to examine the distribution of this important ware. The use of these techniques partitioned the sample into two major compositional groups. These groups formed eastern and western zones of production and exchange that partly overlapped. Three minor Coarse Orange paste recipes were also identified, these are considered to be locally produced variants of the ware. From the compositional data, and supplementary evidence of ceramic production from survey and excavation, we argue that Comoapan traded some ceramics of the CO1 composition to sites along the Catemaco River and into the southern Tuxtlas foothills. These jars were exchanged to all levels of the settlement hierarchy, which may indicate market exchange. Furthermore, the other paste recipes (CO1a, CO2, CO2a, and CO3) were not produced at Matacapan. Group COP6 was a special recipe made only at an attached production locality in the administrative district of Matacapan. We conclude the paper with a methodological consideration that advocates the use of both point mineralogical and bulk chemical techniques to more accurately interrogate compositional data.","2008-05-01","2022-10-05 03:19:00","2022-10-05 03:19:00","2022-10-05 03:19:00","1412-1426","","5","35","","Journal of Archaeological Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Mesoamerica; Ceramics; Craft specialization; INAA; Petrography; Political economy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the fundamental values is the adherence of the rule of law, which constitute a legal obligation across all 27 member states. The rule of law as envisaged by the EU, is aimed towards ensuring good governance and upholding fundamental rights and freedoms for its citizens.   Drawing on the many previous European wars, conflicts and the genocide by Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Germany, the post-World War II EU legal order aims to pre-empt similar situations happening again. In the 2010’s concerns and discussion regarding rule of law and democratic backsliding began to gain traction in the EU. Legislative changes in Hungary seemed to entrench the ruling Fidesz party led by Eurosceptic Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. European institutions held that changes made to the national judiciary, which saw the lines blur between politicians, the executive and the judiciary, amounted to a violation of the EU legal order and its rule of law obligation.   In 2015 the Polish right-wing, populist Eurosceptic political party Prawo i Sprawiedliwość swept to power in Poland, winning both the presidency and a parliamentary majority. The new Polish government has since 2015 been on a collision-course with the European Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union over legislative changes to the national judiciary, which according to the EU breaches the rule of law by dismantling checks and balances.   In October 2021, the Polish Constitutional Tribunal rejected the principle of primacy of EU law as a response to the criticism from European institutions. The ruling saw the EU-Polish tug-of-war over the rule of law sharply escalate. The rule of law in the European Union and the recent events in Poland is of greater public interest as it comes in a volatile global situation. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, global terrorism, migration and potential geopolitical conflicts in Europe are all factors which affect the European Union.   Domestic rifts between member states and the EU political leadership risks eroding the impact of EU law in member states. By using a multi-faceted interdisciplinary methodological approach, through the doctrinal legal method, the comparative legal method and document analysis, various contrasting perspectives are interpreted with a broad epistemological understanding in mind, in order to explain the situation. This study will investigate the situation through critical analysis and answer what rule of law backsliding tell us about EU values, how the rule of law is enforceable from an EU perspective, and how rule of law backsliding has been developing in Poland and why.   The rule of law in the EU is a highly complex and opaque issue. Poland’s standpoint can be traced to its history and the constitutional culture in part owing to the communist-era weak legal culture and a modern political will geared towards national sovereignty. Concerns about the efficiency of enforcement of the EU’s own legal framework point towards larger issues relating to the legal structure of which the EU is built upon. In the face of a global volatile state, it can be considered imperative the European Union be adequately prepared to enforce its own structure, or risk internal disintegration.","2022-01-28","2022-10-05 03:20:02","2022-10-05 03:20:06","2022-10-05 03:20:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","gupea.ub.gu.se","","Accepted: 2022-01-28T09:35:19Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper then traces the heretical distortion of Luther's resistance thinking in nineteenth and twentieth century neo-Lutheran dualistic two-kingdoms teaching, which assimilated the prevailing culture either actively or passively, climaxing in the ethical bankruptcy of Nazi Germany. Part II presents a typology of four post-World War II American Lutheran ethical revisions which have reappropriated much of Luther's struggle-resistance understanding. All four types offer the basic dialectical-response model of critical conformity when governance operates under God against evil; critical reformism when governance is errant but changeable; and critical resistance when governance takes on demonic features. The Participatory Reform-Resistance type is consciously faithful to Luther's thinking, applying it to the context of pluralistic society in Niebuhrian ""Christian Realism"" fashion. The Christological-Trinitarian type is informed by Bonhoeffer's Christology, calling for a prophetic vision akin to the Anabaptist tradition. The Confessing Movement's Struggle-Resistance type addresses resistance within the church when errant or demonic features displace the authority of the gospel. Finally, the Historical-Eschatological type emphasizes the explosive implications of the proleptically present future kingdom of God as the essential ingredient which can make the two-kingdoms and twofold governances teaching a struggle-resistance ethic. The expressed intent of this dissertation is to break the stranglehold of the dualistic neo-Lutheran ""two-kingdoms"" heresy, and to offer the proposal of resistance as a Lutheran and ecumenical model for the church in apocalyptic times.","","2022-10-05 03:21:59","2022-10-05 03:21:59","2022-10-05 03:21:59","","297","","","","","Contemporary Two-Kingdoms and Governances Thinking for Today's World","","","","","Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago","United States -- Illinois","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Th.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798206299694","","","","","Philosophy; religion and theology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It makes contributions on the theoretical and empirical levels.  First, it integrates two theoretical standpoints on co-production from the public  administration/management and services management literatures. This integration  forms the basis for the development of an original conceptual framework which  differentiates three modes of co-production at the level of the individual service user:  consumer co-production; participative co-production; and enhanced co-production.  The thesis then extends co-production to consider organizational modes, considering  specifically the role of voluntary and community organizations (VCOs) in the  production of services. This discussion contributes to the expansion of the  conceptual framework, by introducing the concepts of co-management and co-governance  to refer to VCOs co-production in service delivery and in service  planning and delivery, respectively. The result is the development of a ‘Typology of  Co-production’ which differentiates all five types of co-production according to who  co-produces public services and when.  These two conceptual frameworks are used to explore the case of asylum seekers and  the social welfare services they receive in Glasgow. The case of asylum seekers is  particularly interesting given the marginal nature of the group and their legal position  as non-citizens. This serves to sharpen the focus on co-production.  Three research questions emerged from the theoretical work which are explored in  the case of asylum seekers: to what extent is co-production dependent upon  citizenship? Can co-production act as a conduit to build social inclusiveness and  citizenship? And is individual service user co-production a prerequisite for co-production  and partnership working by public service organizations?  The study took a mixed methods approach, consisting of policy/practice interviews, a  small survey of public service organizations providing services to asylum seekers and an embedded case study design of Glasgow, which involved a series of  interviews, observations and document analysis. The empirical context provided a  fertile ground to explore and better understand the five types of co-production  differentiated in the theory. It further suggests that citizenship is not a prerequisite  for each mode of co-production and also that the co-production of public services  can positively impact the lives of asylum seekers, particularly around issues of  integration.","2013-07-03","2022-10-05 03:22:14","2022-10-05 03:22:17","2022-10-05 03:22:14","","","","","","","Understanding the co-production of public services","","","","","","","en","","","","","era.ed.ac.uk","","Accepted: 2013-09-25T14:04:54Z Publisher: The University of Edinburgh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I argue that the Khmer wish both to embrace the tenets of contemporary democracy, yet also to reclaim the ancient culture the Khmer Rouge set out to destroy. The physical and psychological tolls of decades of civil war and upheaval in Cambodia can never be adequately measured, and will never cease to inform the Khmer experience. Yet the Khmer are resilient, and have navigated centuries of uncertainty, incorporating new practices and adapting Khmer ways of life as a constant strategy for maintaining their kindred identity, superseding changes in leaders, occupiers, explorers, and settlers. Moreover, Khmer cultural values and traditions are shaping the ways in which democracy is incorporated into society. My thesis is that Khmer, as part of their identity renegotiation process, do and will continue to draw upon various cultural traditions and stories to make sense of their positions as members of a society now built upon a new framework--that is, they can and will ""Khmerize"" democracy by recognizing the old within the new (and vice versa). I suggest that Khmer are making choices about their futures, rather than allowing their neighbors or the international community to choose for them, and that the Khmer in my study are choosing democracy. This dissertation examines the ways in which Khmer actively participate in the dialogue about democracy and how it fits into their political, economic, social, and cultural futures.","2003-12","2022-10-05 03:22:37","2022-10-05 03:22:37","2022-10-05 03:22:37","","","","","","","Tradition and change","","","","","University of Hawaii at Manoa","","en","","","","","scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The majority of these behaviors are considered ‘aggressive’, and these aggressive behaviors are considered to form a continuum from mild (e.g., darts) to severe (e.g., falling fights). In this paper we focus on darts, the most common of the dominance behaviors, and investigate their function in un-manipulated post-emergent colonies of the primitively eusocial wasp P. fuscatus. Here we show that darts are correlated with the more severe dominance behaviors, and that dominance ranks do not change with the addition or exclusion of darts. We find no correlation, however, between receiving darts and receiving more severe dominance behaviors. This result suggests that darts are not indicative of aggressive reinforcement of dominance, but rather may serve a different function. Our data suggest that the function of darts is to regulate activity on nests. Both foundresses and workers dart inactive workers significantly more often than by chance, and workers respond to a foundress’s (but not a worker’s) dart by becoming less inactive. We also found that active workers who receive a dart from either a foundress or worker respond mostly by switching from one activity to another. Thus, our data suggest that darts are not aggressive behaviors, that foundresses use this signal to initiate activity, and that foundresses and workers both use the signal to regulate worker activity.","2004-05-01","2022-10-05 03:23:03","2022-10-05 03:23:03","2022-10-05 03:23:03","220-223","","5","91","","Naturwissenschaften","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Dominance Hierarchy; Colony Cycle; Dominance Behavior; Dominance Score; Paper Wasp","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results show that the establishment or upgrade of partnerships has had a positive effect on Chinese firms’ decisions on OFDI for at least the short term, especially for firms with higher demand for policy guarantees from the government, such as non-central firms and non-Beijing firms. The results also show that the increase in OFDI is concentrated in host countries with higher political risks, such as developing countries, neighboring countries, and Belt and Road countries, which is consistent with China's diplomatic focus.

The first core argument is a criticism of ‘identity’ views of metaphysics, in particular Haslangerian social constructivist metaphysics. Having made this criticism, I argue in favour of using the notion of ‘habitus’ from Bourdieu to account for the functional signature traditionally associated with identity, and apply this way of thinking about social metaphysics to social class. The second core argument applies social constructivist metaphysics to the issue of situated knowledge. I argue that we can conceive of much of situated knowledge as being knowledge-how, rather than propositional knowledge. I do this by arguing that only knowledge-how can justify the social epistemic norms that are ascribed to situated knowledge. The third core argument applies this view of situated knowledge to political philosophy. I argue against the interpretation of my previous arguments as supporting epistocracy, and in doing so combine Thomas Christiano's instrumentalist argument for democracy with the demographic argument against epistocracy, creating a new 'demographic instrumentalist' argument for democracy.  The sum of these three core arguments is an argument for the importance of maintaining a diverse set of decision-makers in political decision making.","2021-07-21","2022-10-05 03:23:42","2022-10-05 03:23:42","2022-10-05 03:23:42","","289","","","","","","","","","","University of Birmingham","","English","","d_ph","","","etheses.bham.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Theologically, although Calvin and other Reformed theologians argued that Scripture dictated a form of government for the local church, on a collective level, church government was to be adapted to changing historical and cultural circumstances. Bucer, Calvin and Beza all initially called for a limited episcopacy operating within a synodical system; the French Reformed Churches rejected this idea, opting instead for a system with a limited, temporary moderatorship, thus paving the way for the later ""presbyterial"" polity adopted by the other Reformed churches of Western Europe. This new form of moderatorship was a natural outgrowth of Reformed principles of equality among ministers and independence of churches, though no earlier theologians seem to have articulated it. In general, the system of collective government was designed to deal with problems or questions in the church on as local a level as possible, and thus the synodical system included multiple levels with increasing geographical competence, ranging from the Colloquy, a collection of churches in an area, to the Provincial Synod, and finally the National Synod. On a local level, the French Reformed Churches introduced a number of innovations. They developed a new form of diaconate, combining a Reformed definition of the deacon as the charitable arm of the church with some of the catechetical and liturgical responsibilities of Roman Catholic deacons. The French Reformed Churches also pioneered the inclusion of the deacons on the Consistory. Initially, there were two Consistories in the local church, one for ecclesiastical functions the other for discipline; these were combined into a single council which included the deacons, leading ultimately to the collapse of the office of deacon with that of elder.","","2022-10-05 03:23:55","2022-10-05 03:23:55","2022-10-05 03:23:55","","283","","","","","From French Protestantism to the French Reformed Churches","","","","","The University of Wisconsin - Madison","United States -- Wisconsin","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798208598856","","","","","Social sciences; Philosophy; religion and theology; Reformed churches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, they remain a critical part of conservation because they are the only way to actively restore a species into a habitat from which it has been extirpated. Past efforts to improve these practices have attributed the low success rate to failures in the biological knowledge (e.g., ignorance of social behavior, poor release site selection), or to the inherent challenges of reinstating a species into an area where threats have already driven it to local extinction. Such research presumes that the only way to improve reintroduction outcomes is through improved biological knowledge. This emphasis on biological solutions may have caused researchers to overlook the potential influence of other factors on reintroduction outcomes. I employed a grounded theory approach to study the leadership and management of a successful reintroduction program (the Sea Eagle Recovery Project in Scotland, UK) and identify four critical managerial elements that I theorize may have contributed to the successful outcome of this 50-year reintroduction. These elements are: 1. Leadership & Management: Small, dedicated team of accessible experts who provide strong political and scientific advocacy (“champions”) for the project. 2. Hierarchy & Autonomy: Hierarchical management structure that nevertheless permits high individual autonomy. 3. Goals & Evaluation: Formalized goal-setting and regular, critical evaluation of the project’s progress toward those goals. 4.

Discussions on the connections between anarchism and cybernetics did not advance very far, however, and by the 1970s the topic seems to have fallen off the anarchist radar. With an increase in interest in cybernetics over the last few years, this paper picks up where these debates left off and highlights some key points of contact between cybernetics and anarchism that have the potential to advance radical accounts of self-organisation. Based on a theoretical appraisal of the core texts and arguments in the debate around anarchism and cybernetics, the paper shows that the way in which hierarchy is formulated in cybernetic thought has a crucial impact on anarchist theory and practice and aids both academic approaches to social movements and, importantly, anarchist and radical left praxis. In addition, it provides a response to the critique of cybernetics in critical management studies that stands as a barrier to taking cybernetics seriously as a contribution to radical understandings of organisation.","2018-01-01","2022-10-05 03:25:41","2022-10-05 03:25:41","2022-10-05 03:25:41","","","","","","","Towards an anarchist cybernetics","","","","","","","en","","","","","repository.lboro.ac.uk","","Publisher: Loughborough University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human society, a superhuman domain, types of medical knowledge and practice, and specific remedies are all understood to be hierarchized in accord with differentially refracted power. The landowning Sayyid family, descended from both the Prophet Muhammad and a prominent saint in Swat, collapsed the distinct roles of landlord and saintly mediator into a unified, apically-focused pattern of authority when they conquered Kaghan. Enfeoffed and legalized by the British during the 19th Century, they claim to have been the only healers in the valley. Now challenged by poor farmers who desire to keep the profit from a new potato crop, and by religious conservatives who condemn all forms of saintliness as against Islam, they defend their position in the courts and by narration of the story of their conquest. In a highly evocative performance the family historian recounts miraculous events that demonstrate divine blessing on their rulership. Kaghanis employ the humoral idiom of Yunani Tibb (Greco-Islamic medicine) to describe minor health problems, and attribute much sickness to beings and forces of the invisible, superhuman domain. They use herbal medicines, wear amulets, and seek varieties of spiritual and biomedical remedy in rapid succession, yet believe that efficacy of any treatment ultimately depends upon Allah's will. In villages, the boundaries between popular, folk, and professional medicine are highly permeable. The dynamics of purdah and family honor greatly complicate women's access to treatment, and survival to age five is precarious, especially for boys. Outside the community, villagers frequently distrust biomedical practitioners because their moral character is suspect and the clinic structure unfamilial. However, some report long trips to see doctors, much as they formerly discussed pilgrimages to shrines. Among the first non-landlord representatives elected to local government, was a successful exorcist legitimized by a dramatic story of courage during initiation. Despite recent social change, the unquestioned intertransformability of religious virtuosity and political legitimacy remains grounded in a prior, more fundamental religio-moral power.","","2022-10-05 03:27:08","2022-10-05 03:27:08","2022-10-05 03:27:08","","881","","","","","The power to heal","","","","","Harvard University","United States -- Massachusetts","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798643111108","","","","","Social sciences; Philosophy; religion and theology; healing; Islam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to research, a persuasive approach to audit and forensic engagements allows for higher concessions from the client which improves information accuracy and creates a better affective environment resulting in happier clients more likely to retain and recommend the auditor. Simply by giving attention to persuasive tactics, the results are improved compared to without use of persuasive tactics, but there are a number of tactics and tactical categories that are more effective than others. Some discussed tactics include: threatening a qualified audit opinion, reciprocity method, and social validation theory.

"KEXAHPAB","thesis","2016","Tang, Ning","Attitudinal professionalism among social work license holders in China","","","","","https://ir.ua.edu/handle/123456789/2752","The social work profession has become a crucial political tool in China’s welfare and social service delivery system. In the Mid- to Long-term Planning of Building Social Work Professional Community (2011-2020), the state calls for 1,450,000 professional social workers by 2020. The social work licensure exam has become the most convenient path to create a large amount of professional social workers within a short period of time. Yet little is known about the characteristics and the professionalism of the social work license holders. This study aimed to examine the relationships between formal education, professionalism, and bureaucracy level experienced by the social work license holders from Shunde, Guangdong. The population of social work license holders in Shunde was invited to participate in an online survey. A total of 256 social workers completed the survey, representing sixteen percent of the population. Regression models were conducted to assess associations with level of professionalism, educational background, and experiences with organizational bureaucracy. The findings of this study demonstrated that the majority of social work license holders had not received social work formal education; formal education failed to predict greater professionalism; some aspects of bureaucracy were positively associated with some aspects of professionalism; and the professional socialization occurring in the field may be more effective than current formal social work education in cultivating practitioners’ attitudinal professionalism. Four suggestions were drawn from this study to promote social work professionalism: encourage social work educators and researchers to be more active in the field, create more social work positions/titles in the traditional social service delivery system, strengthen the functions of professional associations, and enforce continuing education among social work license holders. These suggestions may also be useful for other countries that lack educational resources to develop social work profession.","2016","2022-10-05 03:28:48","2022-10-05 03:28:48","2022-10-05 03:28:48","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Alabama Libraries","","en_US","All rights reserved by the author unless otherwise indicated.","thesis","","","ir.ua.edu","","Accepted: 2017-03-02T19:54:55Z Artwork Medium: electronic Interview Medium: electronic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eschewing the omnivorousness described in recent studies of cultural consumption, comedy audiences make negative aesthetic and moral judgements on the basis of comedy taste, and often make harsh judgements without the disclaimers, apologies and ambivalence so typical of ?taste talk? in contemporary culture. The article demonstrates how, in particular, Dutch and British middle class audiences use their comedy taste to communicate distinction and cultural superiority. We discuss several reasons why such processes of social distancing exist in comedy taste and not other cultural areas: the traditionally low status of comedy; the strong relation between humour and personhood; the continuity between comedy tastes and humour styles in everyday life; as well as the specific position of comedy in the British and Dutch cultural fields.","2013-06-01","2022-10-05 03:28:55","2022-10-05 03:28:55","2022-10-05 03:28:55","179-195","","2","7","","","The Divisive Power of Humour","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The People’s Republic of China has been putting great emphasis on the relations with other developing countries. The eight Portuguese-speaking countries, Angola, Brazil, Cabo Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, São Tomé and Príncipe and Timor-Leste constitute a group with a population of around 250 million people, a vast wealth of natural resources and potential for gaining economic and political importance in the near future. The way China frames its rhetorical communication and establishes relationships must be understood to provide a perspective on its foreign policy. Political communication involves a ritual with a rhetor, a message and an audience. This phenomenon and the resulting interaction need to be approached from a political perspective in order to understand the dynamics of communication and power. The theoretical framework consists of using rhetorical criticism to analyse the speeches made by the Chinese and Angolan representatives at the Forum for Economic and Trade Cooperation between China and the Portuguese-speaking Countries (Forum Macao) in 2003 and 2006 as well as China’s African Policy official document. Roderick P. Hart and Sonja K. Foss describe models that serve as guides for rhetorical criticism. One of the most useful models to perform a rhetorical analysis is Kenneth Burke’s dramatistic theory and its concepts: the pentad, hierarchy, identification, and the guilt, purification and redemption cycle. As for the power component, Chinese diplomacy is using what is labelled in the specialized terminology as soft power. It focus more on the power of attraction and it is a term devised in 1990 by Professor Joseph S. Nye. It is thought-provoking to analyse how political argumentation is constructed to present political messages. In this thesis, Chinese rhetoric and its soft power actions will be explored to understand the relationship with Angola. Thus, rhetorical criticism and soft power provide a framework to analyse which aspects are either emphasised or neglected in the official rhetoric. These tools are essential to understand what has happened and what is happening. In addition, one might be able to gain a wider knowledge on the role that China can play vis-à-vis the other developing countries: a development partner, an economic competitor or a coloniser.","2014","2022-10-05 03:29:14","2022-10-05 03:29:20","2022-10-05 03:29:14","","","","","","","China's rhetoric and soft power towards the Portuguese-speaking countries","","","","","","","eng","This publication is copyrighted.

"9UM2V246","thesis","2008","Taylor, Deborah","Reading Utopian Narratives in a Dystopian Time","","","","","https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/8014","This dissertation is a feminist study of the reading process of contemporary utopian novels by women: Ursula K. Le Guin, Octavia Butler, and Toni Morrison.  These novels are not utopias, in the sense of place, since they are set in dystopian times.  Instead, this study explores the reading process as a part of a text's presentation of utopian desire. The first chapter focuses on Le Guin's 1985 <em>Always Coming Home</em>, set in a future United States polluted by environmental toxins and divided between a patriarchal Condor nation, and a communal, matrilineal, and non-hierarchical Kesh culture.  Le Guin uses a made-up language, constructed without hierarchies, concepts from Native American story-telling and Taoist philosophy, and multiple narrators to encourage a collaborative reading process where readers weave a utopian vision from the pieces of Kesh culture, balanced against the Condor.  The second chapter examines Butler's <em>Parable of the Sower </em>(1993) and <em>Parable of the Talents </em> (1997).  In this future, California has disintegrated into anarchy and violence, and Lauren Olamina survives the razing of her walled community, creates Earthseed - a new philosophy-religion, and founds a utopian settlement that is destroyed by Christian fundamentalists.  Butler parodies false utopias--gated communities, company towns, and the Christian Right--and presents Lauren's religion, Earthseed, built on the idea of ""God is Change,"" as a utopian alternative.  Butler merges the genres of diary, scripture, jeremiad, and slave narrative to offer a collaborative reading experience.  False utopian ideals of exclusivity, security, and institutionalized religion are resisted by meditating on Earthseed Scriptures.  The third chapter considers Morrison's <em>Paradise</em> (1998), set in western United States, and recounts the story of an all-black town, Ruby, and its destruction of an all-women ""convent"" near the town.  Because Morrison tells her story with non-chronological fragments and multiple viewpoints, the reader must become the point of view character, constructing a coherent narrative and image of paradise from conflicting accounts.  Morrison explores spiritual connectedness and healing by drawing on the history of all-black townships and all-women communities. The narrative strategies of these novels--defamiliarzation, polyvocalism, fragmented structure, and meditation--encourage readers to collaborate in exploring utopian desire.","2008-01-08","2022-10-05 03:29:31","2022-10-05 03:29:34","2022-10-05 03:29:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_US","","","","","drum.lib.umd.edu","","Accepted: 2008-06-20T05:30:34Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exploring the history of Norway as a donor provides the possibility for commenting on some of the stated motives; however, it also becomes apparent through the historical review that there is more to the issue of aid motivation than what is represented by the stated guiding motives. Attempting to establish a better conception of the holder of motives behind development policy, the administration’s role is identified as an interesting point of departure. Establishing the role of the administration in the formation of development policy is believed to provide the possibility for scrutinising the concept of the state as a singular and unitary actor.Performing the analysis based on empirical material generated by a distributed survey and follow-up interviews, the administration is indicated to be a sizable actor in the field of development policy. The scope and volume along with the complex issues making up the policy field, are found to tilt the advantage in favour of the administration. However, although the administration is characterised as being resourceful and central, the political authorities are found to be decisive in drawing up the broad lines and the general structure framing the manoeuvrability of the administration. Thus, the macro-policies are found to be the domain of the politicians while the bureaucrats enjoy considerable latitude on the more specific micro-level. Relating the findings of the analysis to the overarching issue of motives in development policy, the concept of the holder of these motives as a “collective actor” seems satisfactory only on the most abstract level. On a more detailed micro-level the exploration of the administration’s role in development policy have provided insight into aspects concerning the microfoundation of development assistance and thus established the domestic origin of national policies in the field of development policy.","2005","2022-10-05 03:29:53","2022-10-05 03:29:53","2022-10-05 03:29:53","","","","","","","Motives in Development Policy, whose are they really?","","","","","The University of Bergen","","eng","The author","Master thesis","","","bora.uib.no","","Accepted: 2006-05-10T12:25:38Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bolsa Família transfers are viewed as an income shock because they alter the income composition in terms of earned and unearned income. The analysis is undertaken using the values of the transfers as the treatment indicator to show how the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) varies according to the amount received. ATT estimates obtained from the Propensity Score Weighting method lead to the conclusion that PBF marginally diminishes the supply of weekly work hours of working adults. The heterogeneous impacts of the cash transfers on men and women depending upon how they are placed in formal and informal sectors, agricultural and non-agricultural sectors and wage rate ranges are also assessed. The results indicate a nil average effect on probability of working and a marginal reduction in the supply of labour hours for men and women. The impact is greater for informal workers and unpaid workers and is more significant for higher values of the transfers.","2010","2022-10-05 03:30:16","2022-10-05 03:30:16","2022-10-05 03:30:16","","","","","","","","","","","","Working Paper","","eng","http://www.econstor.eu/dspace/Nutzungsbedingungen","Working Paper","","","www.econstor.eu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It looks beyond math education culture to the general culture, examining the way mindset is constructed and sustained through its discursive expressions in written and spoken language and identifying the positioning it entails and its consequences for learners, educators and policymakers. I explore the notion that due to their similar experience as learners, Israeli math education policymakers hold similar beliefs about math ability. Mapping the mindset behind these shared perceptions, I trace its existence within policy (where it gains authority), as well as its positioning of learners in ways that strengthen and support cultural perceptions while hindering equity. My research addresses complex issues at the personal, social, and political levels. Discourse provides the underlying methodological cornerstone for this study. Discourse analysis serves both for excavation and interpretation of dispositions and mindsets embedded in policy, as well as for the negotiation and re-conceptualization of identities, positions, and policy. Looking at policymakers’ commitment and passion for math education and its promotion, alongside the difficulty in addressing learners whose experience of math is very different from their own, there may be a need for special support in the process of policy and curriculum creation. There may be need for a greater variety of voices in the math education committees, voices that are as passionate about math education and the possibility of promoting it among learners of different dispositions, voices that should echo the position and outlook of different learners.","2020-09-23","2022-10-05 03:30:26","2022-10-05 03:30:26","2022-10-05 03:30:26","","","","","","","Those Who Can","","","","","Werklund School of Education","","eng","University of Calgary graduate students retain copyright ownership and moral rights for their thesis.

Thus it contrasts with the Dumontian understanding which I argue is dominated by a 'secular' point of view. This approach enables us to clarify the ideological situation of the village Harijans (ex-Untouchables) and to properly analyze their practices. This ultimately contributes to the still inadequate studies of Harijans. The reconsideration of pollution from a cosmological viewpoint, which leads us to focus on pollution associated with life crises and the cults of local deities, elucidates the essential (deep) dimension of pollution which I term ""pollution"". That is, ""pollution"" indicates the creative dimension of pollution which contains the logic of sacrifice. In this sense, ""pollution"" should be clearly distinguished from the shallow dimension of pollution, defined as ""impurity"", which has an unambiguously negative connotation as the opposite of ""purity"". Through a comparison of the practices of the dominant castes in the village (the Pillais and the Kallars) and those of the Harijans (the Paraiyars), in terms of funeral ceremonies, cults of lineage deities and the activities of the local Milk Cooperative Society, it is revealed that the dominant castes and the dominated Paraiyars primarily share a basic Tamil culture which holds ""pollution"" ideology as its fundamental value, even though the dominant castes manipulate the ideology of ""purity-impurity"" for their social domination. It is also argued that the practices of the Paraiyars can not be understood by a static and simplistic viewpoint, like that of consensus and disjunction theories, but that they should be interpreted as complex procedures which are strategies for seeking self-development. The findings of this thesis, therefore, are that between the dominant castes and the Harijans there is both cultural consensus based on ""pollution"" ideology and disjunction in terms of their interpretative and strategic manoeuvres.","","2022-10-05 03:31:25","2022-10-05 03:31:25","2022-10-05 03:31:25","","550","","","","","","","","","","University of London, School of Oriental and African Studies (United Kingdom)","England","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780355380545","","","","","Social sciences; India; Philosophy; religion and theology; (UMI)AAI10673063; Tamil villages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A survey was mailed to 606 individuals who received an Administrative certification from the Pennsylvania Department of Education between the period of 1994 and 1998, with 425 (70%) of the surveys being returned. A loglinear analysis was performed to examine the relationships of pursuers and non-pursuers relative to age, years in education, motive for certification, job assignment when certified, marital status, and gender. All other research questions were analyzed by the Chi-square and Cramer's V statistical tests. Findings revealed statistically significant effects among the variables of career motivators, gender, age, years in education, ethnicity, motives, job assignments, and the presence of a mentor relating to the pursuit of the principalship. There was a link between these variables and pursuing a principalship. Conversely, findings revealed no significant effects for career detractors, marital status, and gender/marital status and the pursuit of a principalship. The specific career motivators yielding significant differences between pursuers and non-pursuers were: (a) greater help to students and parents, (b) personal drive, (c) timing and availability of the position, (d) prior experience and success in leader roles, (e) formal academic preparation, (f) challenge of the position, (g) leadership responsibility, and (h) greater opportunity to effect change. In all cases, the pursuers were more likely to identify these variables as motivators than were the non-pursuers. The study further revealed that: (a) the proportion of males that pursued a principalship is significantly greater than the proportion of females, (b) a person age 34 or under is significantly more likely to pursue a principalship position, (c) a person in education 6–9 years is significantly more likely to pursue the principalship, (d) certified, minority individuals are significantly more likely to pursue than certified Caucasians, (e) the primary motive for seeking certification is “to become a principal,” and (f) pursuers were significantly more likely to have a mentor than were non-pursuers.","","2022-10-05 03:31:37","2022-10-05 03:31:37","2022-10-05 03:31:36","","190","","","","","","","","","","Lehigh University","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493204406","","","","","Education; Pennsylvania; Principalship; Public schools","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this purpose, it examines the Community-Led Local Development (CLLD), a policy tool of the EU Cohesion Policy 2014–2020, which has generated more than 3000 local initiatives across the EU. An institutionalist perspective enables a reflection on the multi-level normative dimensions of these local initiatives. A combination of the post-functionalist governance theory, the soft space debate, state-theory and strategic-relational approach provides an interpretative framework to be deployed for a dedicated research agenda. The interpretative challenge is about whether the CLLD enables spatial-temporal fixes in which a deliberative polity pursues a spatial imaginary for an ad-hoc territory. The consequent analytical dimensions can be found in (a) the relationship between attendant ad-hoc polity, policy agenda, territorial design and societal processes; and (b) the meta-governance dimensions that locate the bottom-up constituency of this institutional technology in the shadow of state’s hierarchy.

By matching employer-employee data with firm loans and bank balance sheets, I study firms' reactions to a credit shock—the global financial crisis—and compare it to a trade shock—the entry of China in the WTO. When hit by a credit supply shock, firms reduce employment of higher-skilled workers more than lower-skilled production workers, while no adjustment is found on the wages. In contrast, a trade shock affects the hierarchy of the firm from the bottom to the top: firms rescale the organization and reduce employment at all levels. Results support the existence of heterogenous complementarities between working capital and skills along the hierarchy of the firm. Abstracting from general equilibrium effects, I find that firms' organization is a key channel in the transmission of credit shocks to the real economy.","2020","2022-10-05 03:33:13","2022-10-05 03:33:13","2022-10-05 03:33:13","","","","","","","Shocks and the Organization of the Firm","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","credit shock; firm organization; trade shock","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3536729","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Between 1750 and 1950, Hyderabad served as the capital of the Asaf Jahs (known more popularly as the Nizams), a dynasty whose sovereignty was constrained by the pressures of British indirect rule. Hyderabad's urban identity centered on the Asaf Jahi landholding aristocracy and the patrimonial ruler, the Nizam, but the distinctness of this urban form also was derived from interactions with the establishment, growth, and decline of British power in South Asia. In this work, I examine how Hyderabad's patricians used the built environment to negotiate transitions from premodern institutions and patterns of organization to the modern ones that transformed urban and political life in South Asia. Using a broad set of interdisciplinary cultural materials from architecture, political ritual and photographs; to maps, records and urban lore in Persian, Urdu and English, I analyze the relationship between architecture's role in shaping social groups and its role in political performance. Six trends of urban patronage shaped Hyderabad's development. Patrons focused on institutions that successively ordered military campaigns, diplomacy, prayers and festivals, spiritual charisma, travel and hospitality, and governance and education. Each building category emphasized a new social organization. Each new social movement required the Nizams to ritually construct their power in terms of a markedly different collective identity. From military commanders to charismatic leaders and globetrotting aristocrats, the salience of these identities was tied to political innovations, but Hyderabadis consistently chose to build with styles that first developed in other times and places. The practices and visual forms that came to define Asaf Jahi culture in Hyderabad—including institutions such as shrines and mosques, rituals such as Muharram processions and nazr presentations, and hybrid styles of Islamic and European architectural design—show how cultural heritage is deployed strategically as part of processes of social and political change. In analyses of religious identity, urbanism, and the politics of heritage, this thesis provides a local examination of the construction and interaction of two supra-regional identities, Islamic and Imperial, and their engagement in the processes that shaped modernity.","","2022-10-05 04:08:19","2022-10-05 04:08:19","2022-10-05 04:08:19","","706","","","","","Constructing a capital on the edge of empire","","","","","University of Pennsylvania","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780542006463","","","","","Social sciences; Politics; India; Communication and the arts; Capital; Hyderabad; Islamic; Nizams; Patronage; Urban politics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, we explore the potential impact of practicing CD on collaboration and team members' responsibilities. Method:We conducted a mixed-method empirical study, which collected data from 21 in-depth, semi-structured interviews in 19 organizations and a survey with 93 software practitioners. Results: There are four common types of team structures (i.e., (1) separate Dev and Ops teams with higher collaboration; (2) separate Dev and Ops teams with facilitator(s) in the middle; (3) small Ops team with more responsibilities for Dev team; (4) no visible Ops team) for organizing Dev and Ops teams to effectively initiate and adopt CD practices. Our study also provides insights into how software organizations actually improve collaboration among teams and team members for practicing CD.

It addresses a basic issue for the sustainability of newspapers: How do newspaper managers deal with newswork changes at a time of uncertainty and complexity? Media management focuses predominantly on the business and audience aspects of the newspaper's operation, with less attention to the professional and social aspects of managing newswork. Media management is not an established academic field, despite its growing popularity and progress in the past two decades. In the scholarship, there is a tendency to apply multidisciplinary knowledge to understand media change. However, many scholars simply 'import' organisational and management theory without questioning the relevance of the theory to their research on newswork.    Drawing upon case studies at three newspaper organisations, this research examines three characteristics distinctive of newspaper organisations — the newspaper as a business with dual goals, news organising as institutionalised and professionalised processes, and newswork as a time machine, so as to explicate the contexts, content and processes of managing newswork during strategic change. It develops Pettigrew's theoretical framework of understanding organisational change by incorporating the sensemaking and sensegiving perspectives, and offers a new perspective on the managing of newswork during strategic change.    The results show that there is a recurring story in the three cases — namely change is emergent, and people’s views on change impact the strategic performance of newspaper organisations. Specifically, newspaper organisation is an emergent environment in which managing and doing newswork are parts of the same strategic processes, and that, therefore, they cannot be treated and studied as separate managerial entities. Applying the sensemaking and related process perspectives, the managing of newswork is understood as a social process of enactment in which both managers and journalists make and give meanings to their practices and in turn make the strategic change — which is emergent, incremental, and idiosyncratic in nature — meaningful and sustainable.    This thesis concludes that during the strategic change, sensemaking about newswork has positive impacts on strategic performances only when the social goal of newswork is addressed simultaneously with the business goal, the past experiences and lessons gained by strategy doers on the frontline are valued and backed up by strategy makers, and when managers give the time and space which allow quality journalism to be achieved. These findings and the novel research design employed contribute to journalism, organisational change, and media management fields of research.","2017","2022-10-05 04:09:13","2022-10-05 04:10:29","2022-10-05 04:09:13","","","","","","","When going digital is inevitable","","","","","","","en","All Rights Reserved","","","","ir.canterbury.ac.nz","","Accepted: 2018-02-22T23:02:28Z Publisher: University of Canterbury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"UG5HQTUP","thesis","2015","Shawei, He","Hierarchical Graph Models for Conflict Resolution","","","","","https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/9826","The hierarchical graph model is developed for representing strategic conflicts having a hierarchical structure. More specifically, in a hierarchical graph model, one or more decision makers (DMs) at a higher level are involved in lower level or local disputes, such as when a central government is participating in separate disputes with different provincial governments. These newly defined hierarchical models constitute significant expansions of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) methodology. Moreover, relationships are developed between preference and stability in local conflicts and those in the higher level conflict. To test and refine the various hierarchical definitions, the new approach is applied to three real world conflicts: controversies over water diversions in China, sales competition of aircraft between Airbus and Boeing, and the dispute between the USA and China over greenhouse gas emissions. DMs are provided with possible resolutions and guidance for courses of actions to follow, which can be beneficial in a hierarchical conflict.    GMCR is a conflict analysis methodology that possesses a flexible structure which allows it to be applied to a wide range of real world disputes. Hierarchy in a graph model is defined in this thesis for describing the structure of a complex conflict that includes smaller interrelated conflicts. In a hierarchical graph model, DMs are classified as common decision makers (CDMs) and local decision makers (LDMs). They can initiate different types of moves, and have interrelated preferences.    Among the different hierarchical graph models, the basic hierarchical graph model has the simplest structure, containing three DMs: a CDM appearing in both of the two smaller conflicts, plus one LDM in each of the two smaller conflicts. A duo hierarchical graph model has two CDMs and two local conflicts. Each LDM, together with both CDMs, appears in one local conflict. A general hierarchical model may include any number of smaller or local conflicts, and any number of CDMs and LDMs.     Stability results in a graph model reflect different solution concepts or stability definitions. Because of the connections between local conflicts, stability in the hierarchical model can be partially obtained from the stability calculations in local models. One component of this thesis is the investigation of the stability interrelationships between stabilities in a hierarchical graph and those in the local conflicts.     Hierarchical graph models can be applied to various practical conflicts. Water diversion conflicts in China, caused by the implementation of the South-North Water Diversion Project, are an excellent example. The duo hierarchical graph model can model a competition between Airbus and Boeing, regarding the marketing of wide-body and narrow-body aircraft in the Asia Pacific region. Conflicts between China and the USA over compliance with a bilateral greenhouse gas emissions agreement are modelled by a hierarchal graph model with a more complicated structure. The disputes take place between the two national governments, both of which also face domestic opposition and concerns.","2015-10-19","2022-10-05 04:09:42","2022-10-05 04:09:42","2022-10-05 04:09:42","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Waterloo","","en","","Doctoral Thesis","","","uwspace.uwaterloo.ca","","Accepted: 2015-10-19T20:14:32Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identifying the mutual connection between outside directors based on their prior shared experience in employment, education and social activities, I measure within-outside-director connectedness by the percentage of connected pairs among all possible outside director pairs. Based on a large sample of US listed companies from 2003 to 2017, I document that within-outside-director connectedness is negatively associated with CEO compensation level, suggesting that the mutual connections within outside directors improve their monitoring role by constraining excess pay to CEO. Moreover, equityform compensation, is mainly affected. Meanwhile, the analysis of connection types implies education-based and social activities-based connections consistently reduce CEO pay, while effect of employment-based connection depends on the role of connected directors during the co-working experience. Additionally, it’s the mutual connection with compensation committee member involved (i.e., at least one in the connected pair is a compensation committee member) that mainly drives this compensation constraint effect. I also find that the clarity of hierarchy within connected outside directors, the connection between CEO and mutually-connected outside directors, firm corporate governance strength and CEO entrenchment power potentially alter the constraint effect.","","2022-10-05 04:11:41","2022-10-05 04:11:41","2022-10-05 04:11:41","","113","","","","","The Effect of Within-Outside-Director Connectedness on Their Monitoring Role","","","","","The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong)","Hong Kong","English","Copyright ProQuest Dissertations Publishing 2019","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781392532003","","","","","CEO; Director; Monitoring role","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, improved understanding of condor socioecology is needed to inform conservation management strategies. We report on the dominance structure of free-ranging condors and identify the causes and consequences of rank in condor populations by matching social status with the behavioral and physical correlates of individual birds. We characterized the hierarchical social structure of wild condor populations as mildly linear, despotic, and dynamic. Condor social groups were not egalitarian and dominance hierarchies regulated competitive access to food resources. Absence of kin-based social groups also indicated that condor social structure is individualistic. Agonistic interactions among condors were strongly unidirectional, but the overall linearity and steepness of their hierarchies was low. Although one aggressive male maintained the highest dominance rank across the 3-year observation period, there was considerable fluidity in social status among condors within middle and lower rank orders. Older condors were more dominant than younger birds and younger males supplanted older females over time to achieve higher status. Dominance rank did not predict the amount of time that a bird spent feeding at a carcass or the frequency that a bird was interrupted while feeding. Thus, younger, less dominant birds are able to obtain sufficient nutrition in wild social populations.","2013-08-01","2022-10-05 04:11:47","2022-10-05 04:11:47","2022-10-05 04:11:47","1227-1238","","8","67","","Behav Ecol Sociobiol","Hierarchical dominance structure in reintroduced California condors","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","California condor; Dominance hierarchy; Reintroduction; Socioecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"PVR83SFX","thesis","2016","Shin, Jaehyung","Evaluation of the Presbyterian Church in Korea's use of assistant pastors : a reformed church polity perspective","","","","","https://repository.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/33062","The Presbyterian Church in Korea (PCK) has an office of assistant pastor. The assistant pastors are viewed as pastors, but there is a distinction between pastors and assistant pastors in both practical ministry and authority. Assistant pastors are inferior to the pastors in all respects, and therefore the system can be defined as hierarchical. The system of assistant pastors has occasionally been questioned by some Presbyterian scholars based on an important principle within Presbyterian Church government, namely the unity and equality of the offices, but it is still exercised in the PCK. Given this context, this study evaluates the justification of the use of assistant pastors in the PCK from a Reformed Church polity perspective. Both Presbyterian Church polity and Reformed Church polity accept the unity and the quality of the offices. However, in this study it   becomes clear that Reformed Church polity not only accepts the unity and equality of the offices, but also implements in and through the relevant church orders. This study may serve as an   impetus for the PCK to consider this problem in more depth, because Reformed Church polity has always upheld this equality in the church without submission to any hierarchical structure.   In an effort to achieve this aim, the study traces the historical establishment and development of the office of assistant pastors. In this process, the major problems of the office of assistant pastors are examined. As a foundation for the evaluation, the study conducts an investigation into the Reformed principle of the offices, and analyses the church orders of contemporary Reformed denominations regarding pastors and assistant pastors. A consideration of the relationship between Scripture, confession and church order from the perspective of Reformed Church polity is suggested that may guide the PCK‟s reconsideration of the matter, as well as a scientific basis to use a Reformed Church polity perspective in such an evaluation. This study aims to contribute to the solution of the problem from the perspective of the unity and   equality of the offices and to motivate the PCK to deal with the problem of assistant pastors in view of the principle involved. It can also offer guidance to brother churches that struggle with   the same principle, but with different results by offering a way in which churches can encourage one another in the matter of church government based on the foundation of Christ, the King of the church. Die Presbiteriaanse Kerk in Korea (PKK) het ŉ amp van assistent-leraar. Die assistentleraars word gesien as leraars, maar daar is ‟n onderskeid tussen leraars en assistentleraars   met betrekking tot die praktiese bediening en die gesag wat aan dié spesifieke amp gekoppel word. Die assistent-leraar is ondergeskik aan die leraar in alle opsigte. Die kerkregeringstelsel van die PKK toon in hierdie opsig kenmerke van ŉ hiërargiese kerkregeringstelsel. Die aspek van assistent-leraars in die kerkregering van die PKK is al by tye deur sommige Presbiteriaanse kerkregtelikes bevraagteken. Die beginsel waarop daardie kerkregtelikes hulle beroep, is die beginsel van die eenheid en gelykheid van al die ampte, maar die praktyk duur nietemin voort in die PKK. Gegewe hierdie konteks poog hierdie studie om die regverdiging vir die gebruik van assistent-leraars in die PKK te evalueer vanuit ‟n Gereformeerde kerkregeringsperspektief. Die hoop is dat dit die PKK sal motiveer om hierdie probleem te heroorweeg aangesien die  Gereformeerde kerkregering, wat die eenheid en gelykheid van die ampte as vertrekpunt beskou, nog altyd die gelykheid onderhou het sonder enige hiërargie. Ten einde hierdie doel te bereik spoor die studie die historiese ontwikkeling van die praktyk van assistent-leraars na. In die proses word die belangrikste probleme wat dié praktyk aan die orde stel, aangedui. As ŉ basis vir die studie word die grondbeginsels van die Gereformeerde ampsbeskouing geformuleer, en die kerkordes van verskeie kontemporêre Gereformeerde denominasies word ondersoek met betrekking tot leraars en assistentleraars. ŉ Heroorweging van die verhouding tussen die Skrif, die belydenis en die kerkorde in Gereformeerde kerkregering bied ŉ riglyn vir die PKK se hersiening van die saak, sowel as wetenskaplike basis vir die gebruik van ŉ  Gereformeerde kerkregeringsperspektief tydens so ŉ hersiening. Die bydrae van die studie berus op ŉ ondersoek van die probleem vanuit die Gereformeerde perspektief van die eenheid en gelykheid van die ampte. Die studie dien as ŉ motivering vir die PKK om die probleem van assistent-leraars in die lig van die betrokke beginsels te hersien. Die studie kan verder leiding bied aan susterskerke wat met dieselfde beginsel   sukkel, al is die uitkomste anders, deur maniere te bied waarop kerke mekaar kan aanmoedig rakende kerkregering vanuit die fondasie van Christus, die Koning van die kerk.","2016","2022-10-05 04:12:04","2022-10-05 04:12:04","2022-10-05 04:12:04","","","","","","","Evaluation of the Presbyterian Church in Korea's use of assistant pastors","","","","","North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus","","en","","Thesis","","","repository.nwu.ac.za","","Accepted: 2019-07-26T10:52:46Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study sought to delineate the factors which would encourage managers to assume the role of teacher to their employees. To that end, an instrument was constructed and validated, which defines and measures the behaviors of a manager educating subordinates in the workplace. It was hypothesized that managers would engage in educative behaviors if they anticipate that teaching subordinates will result in rewards, particularly increased salary and promotion. It was further hypothesized that the lure of rewards would be moderated by managers' perceptions of the risks and costs which teaching subordinates entails, such as the fear of replacement by one's proteges, the loss of status and power by imparting expertise to others, and the effects of diverting attention away from other required functions of management. Using two questionnaire forms, one for managers and one for their respective subordinates, the researcher sought to compare the level of educative behavior (as rated by subordinates) with the data culled from managers, such as the perception of rewards for teaching employees, the assessment of the risks and costs resulting from teaching employees, personal values, the organizational norms regarding mentoring, and a host of demographic and work history variables. Regression analyses and other statistical tools, led the researcher to the findings that the availability of formal rewards is the most powerful inducement to engage in the full spectrum of educative behavior. However, the effects of anticipated promotion or increased income for teaching employees is most salient when managers do not fear that friendliness to subordinates will result in a loss of authority. In the absence of formal rewards, managers refrain from fully developing their employees for fear of being replaced by promising subordinates. The results of this study highlight the importance of the formal reward structure as a transmitter of organizational values and predominant goals. The need to incorporate the education of subordinates in the explicit job description, and some ways to adjust organizational reward structures to enhance human resource development and planning are discussed.","","2022-10-05 04:15:06","2022-10-05 04:15:06","2022-10-05 04:15:06","","185","","","","","The Manager as Educator","","","","","University of Illinois at Chicago","United States -- Illinois","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798206420531","","","","","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The independent context variables were organization size, age, and technology. The independent organization structure variables were centralization of decision making, formalization, professionalism, and structural differentiation. The dependent network variables were connectedness, clustering, hierarchy, density, and multiplexity. A network is a set of individuals linked by a certain type of relation. Each organization in the study was treated as a separate intraorganizational network. The sample was a 52 organization network of agencies which delivered services to youth in the Indianapolis area. Thus the study was an examination of the intraorganizational networks of a large interorganizational network. The intraorganizational network properties were derived for each network from Burt's (1977) ""Structure"" program and from Marsden's (1976) ""Digraph"" program. The context, structure, and network variables were obtained from 52 agency director interviews and 450 employee questionnaires. Two types of network transactional content were studied for each agency. Transactional content refers to the type of network relation. The transactional content studied were client exchanges and communication ties. A set of seventeen research hypotheses relating context, structure, and intraorganizational network properties was developed from the literature. These hypotheses were tested using multiple regression and a model was tested using path-analysis. It was generally found that large organizational size and differentiated organizational structure were associated with highly connected, highly clustered networks that were hierarchically complex and not very dense. Nonroutine technology and high professionalism were found with high connectedness, low clustering, and low hierarchy. None of the context or structure measures were associated with multiplexity. It was concluded that network properties such as connectedness, clustering, hierarchy, and density provide organization theorists with measures of structure which complement traditional structure measures. Organizations can be conceptualized and analyzed as relational networks, and future organization structure research should examine relational networks along with distributional structure characteristics.","","2022-10-05 04:15:36","2022-10-05 04:15:36","2022-10-05 04:15:36","","226","","","","","","","","","","Indiana University","United States -- Indiana","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798205536608","","","","","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The activity of multinational corporations (MNCs) has become a primary driver of globalisation, shaping these relationships through vast networks of firms and their subsidiaries. Extensive empirical research has suggested that globalisation is not a singular process, and that variation in the intensity of international economic interactions can be captured by ‘multiple globalisations’, however how this differs across industry sectors has remained unclear. This paper analyses how sectoral variation in the ‘structural architecture’ of international economic relations can be understood using a combination of social network analysis (SNA) measures based on firm-subsidiary ownership linkages. Applying an approach that combines network-level measures (Density, Clustering, Degree, Assortativity) in ways yet to be explored in the spatial networks literature, a typology of four idealised international network structures is presented to allow for comparison between sectors. All sectoral networks were found to be disassortative, indicating that international networks based on intraorganisational ties are characterised by a core-periphery structure, with professional services sectors such as Banks and Insurance being the most hierarchically differentiated. Retail sector networks, including Food & Staples Retailing, are the least clustered while the two most clustered networks—Materials and Capital Goods—have also the highest average degree, evidence of their extensive globalisations. Our findings suggest that the multiple globalisations characterising international economic interactions can be better understood through the ‘structural architecture’ of sectoral variation, which result from the advantages conferred by cross-border activity within each.","2021-08-16","2022-10-05 04:16:02","2022-10-05 04:16:02","2022-10-05 04:16:02","e0255450","","8","16","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Centrality; Network analysis; Economics; Finance; Economic geography; Communication equipment; Equipment; Semiconductors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Turbulent and endless changes into international environments, high competition, innovation technology development, and consumer shifting towards new needs and behaviors lead companies in finding appropriate strategies to remain competitive. This implies to look continuously for better solutions to structure organizations, manage people, and improve knowledge. Flexible structures allow not only to faster adapt to ever-changing business needs, but also to facilitate information exchange and – when required – modify working procedures and people behaviors. However, any process of organizational change is onerous and finds obstacles to be implemented. Change requires top managers and subordinates involvement, in terms of their comprehension and acceptance of business choices; in this way, they can concretely support innovation. The role of infra-firm communication is here crucial since it represents the vehicle through which change can occur and people can acquire, create and diffuse knowledge. This is the base for developing new strategies and making the firm grows. However, the effort for modifying organizational assets is an endless process. Market forces as well as economic, political and social variations obligate companies to change and readjust their internal resources in order to remain competitive or even to survive.

Twenty practicing and 20 research nurses from Midwestern metropolitan areas were interviewed, using a merged qualitative method, regarding their views of knowing (epistemology) and the fundamental phenomena (ontology) of nursing. In addition, journal article titles from the three most frequently read journals reported by each group of nurses were analyzed. There were two major findings: (a) practicing nurses and nurse researchers were more congruent than incongruent in their perspectives about epistemology and ontology of nursing, and (b) the modes of knowing and ontological domains were highly enmeshed constructs, suggesting a blended epistemology and ontology. Nurses in this study did not separate their knowing and being statements from their practice statements, suggesting a further blend of praxis with epistemology and ontology. Congruities and incongruities were identified in this study. Congruities included four modes of knowing: the self, experience, other people, and traditional ways. Also congruous were the nurses' descriptions of four ontological domains: the self, caring, knowing, and human beings. Variations in the meanings of these constructs were found, introducing congruous and incongruous perspectives. Nurses also reported that knowing was limited by oneself, each other, the systems in which they worked, and by being human. Despite the limitations to knowing, nurses reported many creative ways to know. The incongruities represent areas where differences exist between the two groups of nurses, including the journals they regularly read. Nurses have used these incongruities in their efforts to build practice-research linkages. The congruities represent areas where agreement exists between practicing nurses and nurse researchers. These may provide a solid base upon which to build further linkages between nursing practice and research. Findings suggest that linkage efforts should continue to be made using the incongruities, while also building on the congruities. Findings also suggest that nurses demonstrate oppressed group behaviors, are highly creative, and have much potential for shaping a ideology for nursing that is based upon the perspectives of all nurses.","","2022-10-05 04:17:32","2022-10-05 04:17:32","2022-10-05 04:17:31","","409","","","","","The epistemology and ontology of practicing nurses and nurse researchers","","","","","The University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee","United States -- Wisconsin","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798207173580","","","","","Social sciences; Health and environmental sciences; Philosophy; religion and theology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But capital is essential for the purchase of scientific equipment and the upkeep, updating and expansion of the research facilities. Hence the development of accurate project estimates and the selection of the proposals most beneficial to the scientific advancement is an increasingly critical aspect of delivering Value for Money to the taxpayer. Action Research, using interviews and questionnaires has been undertaken to understand the processes and dynamics within the MRC, motivation of bidders and reasoning of approvers. A database has been developed to test the effectiveness of Reference Class Forecasting, heavily promoted by the UK Government, around science facilities. It was found that a distinct lack of communication between the involved parties led to a failure of understanding of both the bidding process and evaluation criteria as well as project drivers, priorities and assumptions made in the development of the estimates. Furthermore, the charge of strategic misrepresentation should be reviewed considering the way in which government departments distribute funds and/or award specific projects. Arbitrary budget awards force project teams to engineer the requirements to fit in those envelopes. The environment of projects in the public sector was found to be very complex and have a significant influence on project strategies. More research needs to be done to understand these complexities better and consider appropriate actions to mitigate detrimental effects. A programme of continuous improvement within the MRC concluded the first two research cycles and has resulted in a specific strategy to target improvements of project performance. Data from the research is being used to bid for an increase of capital funding to ensure the MRC can deliver the cutting edge, world leading science, which the government expects.","2020-01-10","2022-10-05 04:17:39","2022-10-05 04:17:39","2022-10-05 04:17:39","","203","","","","","","","","","","University of Liverpool","","en","","dba","","","livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Empirical identification of pathways, or histories, requires measures that assess cumulative wear and tear on physiological systems following from psychosocial adversity and genetic predispositions. Such an assessment, allostatic load, has been shown to predict later life mortality, incident cardiovascular disease, and decline in physical and cognitive functioning. Using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), we seek precursors to allostatic load via ordered categories of cumulative adversity relative to advantage over the life course. We operationalize these histories via unfolding economic circumstances and social relationship experiences (e.g., parent-child interactions, quality of spousal ties). Findings reveal a strong direct association between the extent of adversity relative to advantage in an ordering of these histories and likelihood of high allostatic load. Importantly, resilient individuals with economic disadvantage, but compensating positive social relationship histories also show low prevalence of high allostatic load.","1999","2022-10-05 04:17:53","2022-10-05 04:17:53","2022-10-05 04:17:53","96-115","","1","896","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08108.x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Throughout history, gangs were considered surrogate families and gang members were willing to die for their gangs. Current research now demonstrates that despite family dysfunction, gang members choose their family over the gang. The purpose of this study was to provide a theory-based, psychological perspective with which to examine these contradictory research findings. Specifically, the study intended to demonstrate how learned behaviors and family structure influence gang involvement among Latino youth. Method. Using phenomenological, semi-structured interviews, male, Latino juveniles participated in this study. All participants were soft-core gang members. To corroborate their stories, parents were also interviewed using a semi-structured format. Results. Participants learned to be soft-core gang members by observing and modeling the behaviors of other gang members. They were also influenced to join because the quality of their family life was inadequate and parents did not serve as positive role models. Regardless of how dysfunctional the family, however, most participants chose their family over the gang. They had a strong sense of obligation to family and expressed a willingness to die for mothers and siblings, rather than fellow gang members. Discussion. The findings demonstrate that mental health professionals should intervene at the family level when targeting juvenile, Latino, soft-core, gang members. Family therapy should help parents enhance their parenting skills, as well as assist soft-core gang members in becoming “role models” and empowering their younger siblings to choose a better path in life. In order to gain a fuller understanding of family dynamics, more research is needed to explore the quality of family life of medium-core and hard-core gang members, and how it differs from that of soft-core gang members.","","2022-10-05 04:23:36","2022-10-05 04:23:36","2022-10-05 04:23:36","","89","","","","","","","","","","University of La Verne","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Psy.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780496150229","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology; Family; Gang; Youth; Latino; Quality of life","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is relatively little known in the research community about the nature of this change at the post-farm level. The purpose of this dissertation, titled Milling Service Markets, Value Chain Coordination, and Food Attribute Values: Three Essays on the Post-Farm Food System in Tanzania is to help fill this gap by exploring issues surrounding technology channel access for food processors, coordination of food products between processors and retailers, and the value of final food product attributes. In the first essay we use the data from a primary survey of maize flour processing firms in Dar es Salaam to explore the role of milling service markets in providing access to milling technology. We use a utility of profit maximizing framework with key explanatory variables falling in the categories of assets and human capital, perceived risk, and transaction costs. Our findings suggest that the use of milling service markets is associated with a lower asset threshold to entry, lower economies of scope, higher perceived market risk, and lower transaction costs of use. In the second essay we use the same miller data, and data from a primary survey of food retailers in Dar es Salaam and Arusha, to explore market coordination between food processors and food retailers. We use a transaction cost economics (TCE) framework to estimate the correlates of value chain integration from both the processor and retailer point of view, and the correlates of contract use from the processor point of view. Some findings are that (a) at least medium perceived market risk and product perishability (a proxy for temporal asset specificity) are positively associated with (mainly verbal) contract use, but other measures of asset specificity are not significantly associated, and (b) perceived market risk and firm clustering are negatively associated with value chain integration. We argue that a common theme is that wholesalers and traders play a pivotal role in coordinating activity with the food system. In the third essay we use data from the retail survey to estimate the marginal value of food product attributes using a hedonic price analysis, comparing across retail outlet types and the two cities. We find that counter to other recent findings in the literature, traditional retail outlets are generally more price competitive than supermarkets for maize flour products, except for top brands. We also find that products tended to be more expensive in Dar es Salaam than in Arusha, suggesting that there may be decreasing productivity returns to population growth, in addition to a positive income effect.","","2022-10-05 04:32:07","2022-10-05 04:32:07","2022-10-05 04:32:06","","237","","","","","Milling Service Markets, Value Chain Coordination, and Food Attribute Values","","","","","Michigan State University","United States -- Michigan","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780438331648","","","","","Social sciences; Tanzania; Africa; Biological sciences; Food systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scholars highlight that Turkey's economy, position, foreign policy, regional influence and ties to the West have helped contribute or sustain its rise. However, many of these assessments are dated not taking into consideration recent events that have cast doubt on the prospect of Turkey being a rising power. Combining academic and intelligence research, this study takes the form of an OSINT analysis. Utilising a mixed method approach, Turkey is analysed utilising strategic potential analysis. The analysis, throughout the seven factors (physical, resources and communications, human, economic, political and administrative, and military), found that Turkey's weaknesses outnumber, at times negating, and in some instances invalidating the strengths which past scholars have tended to emphasise. The scope and depth of this paper not only highlighted the shortcomings of past scholars' limited and narrow studies, but showed that Turkey neither exhibits the ascendancy to be a rising power nor the potential to transition to a great power. In the end, Turkey's decline in influence allows for other states to play a larger role in the region. As it is no longer seen as a model for secular politics and Islam,...","2017-09-14","2022-10-05 04:35:46","2022-10-05 04:35:51","2022-10-05 04:35:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_US","","","","","dspace.cuni.cz","","Accepted: 2020-08-17T11:28:05Z Publisher: Univerzita Karlova, Fakulta sociálních věd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since I believe that each reader experiencing the epic expects its characters to maintain certain attributes, the crux of my thesis will be to determine if the reader can reconcile his or her expectations about the nature of hierarchy with the actual hierarchy as presented in Milton's text. To better understand Paradise Lost in a way that has not hitherto been studied, I have developed a new perspective- the cognitive paradigm- which centers around the way in which readers structure their experiences. This approach encourages readers to re-structure their current interpretations of the epic's events when new information or schema is presented to them. Although Fish describes the poem's methods as a ""programme of reader harassment"" (1967: 4), I maintain that Paradise Lost invites its readers to embrace the opportunity to re-visit our old assumptions in order to fully experience the text.</p> <p>Chapter One sets forth the dual task of outlining my area of interest and positing an alternative framework for which to analyze the text. Chapter Two focuses on exploring the different attributes of Adam and Eve to determine if the traditional hierarchical reading is supported, whereby Adam possesses superior qualities to his female counterpart. Chapter Three examines the divine and demonic entities of God and Satan and prompts us to consider how Milton's portrayal of these characters affects our understanding of the hierarchy. Chapter Four concludes with a brief overview and offers its readers future points to consider.</p>","2001-05","2022-10-05 04:36:39","2022-10-05 04:36:39","2022-10-05 04:36:39","","","","","","","A 'Curious Mixture'","","","","","","","en","","thesis","","","macsphere.mcmaster.ca","","Accepted: 2014-06-18T16:59:08Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conceptualising the data along the lines of framing theory in a transitioning society, this study explores a new-casteist approach to reporting Dalits.

The search was limited to the past 5 years.ConclusionsTwo types of hierarchies exist: ?functional? and ?dysfunctional.? While functional medical hierarchies aim to optimize patient care through clinical instruction, dysfunctional hierarchies have been linked to negative impacts by creating learning environments that discourage the voicing of concerns, legitimize trainee mistreatment, and create moral distress through ethical dilemmas. Such an environment endangers patient safety, undermines physician empathy, hampers learning, lowers training satisfaction, and amplifies stress, fatigue, and burnout. On the other hand, functional hierarchies may improve resident education and well-being, as well as patient safety.Implications for PracticeOtolaryngology?head and neck surgery programs ought to work toward creating healthy systems of hierarchy that emphasize collaboration and improvement of workplace climate for trainees and faculty. The goal should be to identify aspects of dysfunctional hierarchy in one?s own environment with the ambition of rebuilding a functional hierarchy where learning, personal health, and patient safety are optimized.","2020-11-01","2022-10-05 04:41:41","2022-10-05 04:41:41","2022-10-05 04:41:41","906-914","","5","163","","Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rise of crowdsourcing in recent years has sparked speculation  as to whether something similar might be taking place on crowdsourcing sites, where  hundreds or thousands of people interact with each other. The phenomenon has been  dubbed collective intelligence. This thesis focuses on exploring the role of collective  intelligence in crowdsourcing innovations. The task is approached through three research  questions: 1) what is collective intelligence; 2) how is collective intelligence manifested  in websites involved in crowdsourcing innovation; and 3) how important is collective  intelligence for the functioning of the crowdsourcing sites. After developing a theoretical  framework for collective intelligence, a multiple case study is conducted using an  ethnographic data collection approach for the most part. A variety of qualitative,  quantitative and simulation modelling methods are used to analyse the complex  phenomenon from several theoretical viewpoints or ‘lenses’. Two possible manifestations  of collective intelligence are identified: discussion, typical of web forums; and the  wisdom of crowds in evaluating crowd submissions to websites. However, neither of  these appears to be specific to crowdsourcing or critical for the functioning of the sites.  Collective intelligence appears to play only a minor role in the cases investigated here. In  addition, this thesis shows that feedback loops, which are found in all the cases  investigated, reduce the accuracy of the crowd’s evaluations when a count of votes is used  for aggregation.","2015-12-04","2022-10-05 15:37:59","2022-10-05 15:38:07","2022-10-05 15:37:59","","","","","","","","","","","","Lappeenranta University of Technology","","en","","","","","lutpub.lut.fi","","Accepted: 2015-11-24T14:14:54Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While revisionism is considered important and is studied by scholars and analysts, the existing literature generally seeks to understand revisionism as it relates to great powers and other states. Studies on non-state actors are rare by comparison. This thesis adds to the literature a study on non-state revisionist actors. It argues that there are insurgents who are dissatisfied with the status quo and desire to alter, disrupt, or destroy the regional or international order, but that not all non-state armed groups are necessarily revisionist. Using structured, focused comparison, this study examines three contemporary transnational insurgent groups. Utilizing a generally accepted indicator of revisionism and violent insurgent tactics, the study gauges whether each group is are motivated by a revisionist strategy. The findings of this plausibility probe suggest that two of the cases – al Qaeda, and the Islamic State (ISIS) – merit the label “revisionist”. By contrast, the final case, Boko Haram, should be seen instead as revolutionary because it primarily seeks to disrupt governance dynamics at the state level.","2021","2022-10-05 15:38:58","2022-10-05 15:39:07","2022-10-05 15:38:58","","","","","","","Beyond Revolution","","","","","","","en","","","","","jewlscholar.mtsu.edu","","Publisher: Middle Tennessee State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is determined by the type of secondary school a child has been selected to. The secondary schools in Malawi are classified into three types namely the grant aided, secondary schools, the district conventional secondary schools and the community day secondary schools.  When a pupil has been selected to a grant aided secondary school the general public expectation is that such a student would achieve a high academic standard, similarly when a pupil has been selected to the community day secondary school the public expectation is that such a pupil would not achieve a high academic standard. On the other hand those who are selected to attend the district conventional secondary schools will have an academic achievement which is between the other two types of secondary schools.  This research was carried out to find out the impact of the ADMISSIONS POLICY OF STUDENTS INTO MALAWI SECONDARY SCHOOLS by examining the factors which contribute to disparities in academic achievements from the three types of secondary schools. The study was carried out in Dowa District in the Central Region of Malawi. Specifically it was conducted in the Central East Education Division which is comprised of five education districts namely: Dowa, Ntchisi, Nkhotakota, Salima and Kasungu.  The research was conducted using a number of methods namely: survey questionnaires, convenient sampling, interviews and snowballing. Through the research it was established that the grant aided secondary schools offer excellence of education where many students excel in academics and is seconded by the district conventional secondary schools, while the community day secondary schools offer poor education which attributes to poor academic achievement. The research has explained what has been responsible for the differences in academic achievement.","2014-04-16","2022-10-05 15:39:25","2022-10-05 15:39:32","2022-10-05 15:39:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","uir.unisa.ac.za","","Accepted: 2014-04-16T13:13:27Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

De","Female entrepreneurship in the European Union: are gender equality policies othering women?","","","","","https://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/14172","This research aims to explore the gendered construction of the entrepreneurial discourse in the EU, engaging with post-structural feminist analysis. The purpose is to investigate the practice and process of female entrepreneuring performed by European political actors, involving policy makers, experts and stakeholders across Europe. In Europe only 30% of all entrepreneurs are women. It is a phenomenon that the EU is trying to tackle through gender equality policies. The risk of this kind of policy is the perpetration of a male-centered entrepreneurial discourse, which questions the roots of the principle of equality, as defined in the Maastricht Treaty and the European Charter of fundamental rights. Since the 1970s different scholars have been studying female entrepreneurship using different feminist theoretical approaches, focusing on the relations between gender and class, work and family etc. Those analyses underlined the gendered nature of the entrepreneurship concept, which tends to reproduce an androcentric entrepreneur mentality, making hegemonic masculinity invisible. Since EU gender equality policies are based upon the principle of equal treatment they risk to ´other´ and ´second-sex´ women entrepreneurs. Those policies are based upon specific assumptions, which do not question the liberal conceptualisation of the principle of equality. The objective of the research is to investigate the consequences of ‘othering’ and ‘second-sexing’ women entrepreneurs by European policies, focusing on European agendas and initiatives, such as: Strategy Europe 2020, European Network of Mentors for Women Entrepreneurs, Female Entrepreneurship Ambassadors, Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan. The research wants to open up space for future studies and political actions, in which gender plays a key role as both an analytical and political category. The research is also a contribution to the feminist debate on equality-difference, towards a discourse less rooted in binary oppositions.","2013","2022-10-05 15:39:42","2022-10-05 15:39:42","2022-10-05 15:39:42","","","","","","","Female entrepreneurship in the European Union","","","","","","","en","CC-BY-NC-ND","Master Thesis","","","studenttheses.uu.nl","","Accepted: 2013-08-22T17:01:21Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using regression analysis, the researcher found that over and above the effects of demographic and job-related variable, and work stress and job satisfaction, horizontal individualism could predict union attitudes significantly and negatively whereas vertical individualism and collectivism could predict the attitudes significantly and positively. Similarly, organizational collectivism could predict employees’ attitudes toward union membership significantly and negatively. Using the univariate analysis of variance, the researcher found that the contrast between personal value and organizational culture of an individualist working in a collectivistic organizational culture or collectivist working in an individualistic culture are found to have stronger influence on union attitudes compared to the congruence of an individualist working in an individualistic culture or collectivist working in a collectivistic culture.

This study is a single-case study that focuses on Finetex EnE’s joint venture formation process into the Chinese market.    Finetex EnE is a South Korean company that operates in the nanotechnology field. The company specializes in producing nano-scale fibers and structures through their patented electrospinning process. Finetex EnE is headquartered in Seoul, Korea. The company’s Canadian entity is currently in the process of forming a joint venture with a Chinese partner company in China. This study examines Guanxi from the foreign company’s perspective.    The theoretical background of the study includes literature about SMEs and joint venture formation in China, as well as the role of Guanxi in China. The synthesis of international joint venture formation and Guanxi in China is presented in the end of the theory section. The methodology of this study is based on a qualitative case study, and the empirical data was collected through case company interviews and expert interviews.    According to the main findings of this study, the role of Guanxi is very significant for SMEs that are forming an international joint venture in China. The SME must select an ideal partner company with connections to the Guanxi insiders. Foreigners can never access the core of the Guanxi inner circle, so it is vital for the partner company to have the optimal connections in China. It is also beneficial if the Chinese partner company has contacts to government officials, business-to-government Guanxi, since the legal system of China is weak. Once the SME has managed to cover all of the stages, the SME will have the pre-requisites to form an ideal joint venture in China.    An important finding from the study is the changing nature of the Chinese business culture in entrepreneurship driven companies. Influences from the American business culture can be seen in the way that entrepreneurship driven companies do business in China. The empirical research reveals that the Chinese want to proceed very fast, which is very different from the Confucian type of old-style negotiation that used to exist in China. Further research could examine this phenomenon in more detail and also research the Chinese company’s viewpoint of Guanxi and business-to-government relations.","2017-05-08","2022-10-05 15:41:14","2022-10-05 15:41:19","2022-10-05 15:41:14","","","","","","","Guanxi and international joint venture formation in China","","","","","","","eng","","","","","www.utupub.fi","","Accepted: 2017-05-08T10:42:18Z Publisher: fi=Turun yliopisto.

I   examine the internationalization process through the development and   management of international master’s degree programmes and their relation to   the broader strategy of one particular Finnish university. I interviewed acting   coordinators and directors of the programmes regarding their view on the   administrative work, as well as the structures and resources, related to the   programmes. Strategy documents, internal evaluations, and statistics were also   analyzed.   The omission of an explicit strategy and strategic program for   internationalization led to the marginalization of the international programmes.   The strategic ambiguity contributed to a weak division of labor between the   central administration and the faculties (and the respective programmes).   Research and teaching staff assumed the coordinative responsibility and   operational management. These individuals did not possess formal incentives to   develop the programmes further. Championing activities within programmes   were minimal due to deficiencies in the organization’s architecture. The analysis   emphasizes the importance of identifying and supporting championing activities   within the organization. These activities have the potential of pinpoint   development areas and further enhance the emergence of new strategies and   architecture. The findings suggest that the organization’s architecture and   strategy failed to integrate international education into the traditional activities   of the organization.   This study contributes to the existing literature on organizational   architecture by expanding the notion of emergent architecture and how   championing can influence the architecture. The study also adds to the research   on higher education internationalization and its ramifications to the   organization’s architecture.","2018","2022-10-05 15:42:13","2022-10-05 15:42:13","2022-10-05 15:42:13","","","40","","","","Architecture of dissonance","","","","","","","eng","openAccess","","","","jyx.jyu.fi","","Accepted: 2018-11-29T11:14:55Z ISBN: 9789513976125 Publisher: Jyväskylän yliopisto","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, this researcher looked at two aspects of music learning that are commonly overlooked in beginning violin instruction, (a) pitch accuracy (in major and minor tonalities) and (b) sensitivity to harmonic progression in simple folk-style melodies. As a parallel instrument to the violin, the mandolin provides both a visual reference for correct pitch and immediate audible feedback by the presence of frets on the fingerboard. In addition to providing musicianship skills that benefit executive skill development on the violin, the mandolin can also be used to perform chords using simple finger patterns. Examined were the effects of contemporaneous parallel instrument instruction on executive and musicianship skill development in beginning violin students. The Harmonic Improvisation Readiness Record (Gordon, 2001) was used to evaluate a baseline to measure change in harmonic audiation ability. Students’ pitch accuracy ability was measured and compared across and within two groups; those who participated in aural based violin instruction and those who received the same instruction on mandolin during alternating lesson plans. A multivariate analysis of covariance examined pitch accuracy and harmonic audiation scores. Additionally, this research measured possible evidence of motivation for continued music participation by beginning violin students.","","2022-10-05 15:43:36","2022-10-05 15:43:36","2022-10-05 15:43:36","","133","","","","","","","","","","University of Miami","United States -- Florida","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798644904778","","","","","Beginner pedagogy; Music education; Parallel instrument; String instrument","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This includes structures within the  organisation, as well as social communication networks. Social  communication networks determine the levels of measurement of processes  associated with managerial practises and policies regarding  videoconferencing implementation.  Videoconferencing as a communication management tool should take into  account the numerous applications that videoconferencing hold, but should at  the same time consider all the implications for management. Communication  managers should show a level of sensitivity on interpersonal relationship  establishment and maintenance using a videoconferencing system. Aspects  that should be attended to include alteration of verbal and non-verbal  communication processes, the establishment of virtual relationships and how  it impacts on the social communication network.  The study utilises focus group research, social network analysis and  descriptive statistics in the investigation of manifestation of above-mentioned  variables in the Tertiary Education Linkages Project (TELP), which is a  linkage project between the Eastern Cape Technikon and Texas Southern  University. The study utilises triangulation for establishment of acceptable  levels of reliability and validity.  The analysis of data revealed that videoconferencing facilitates organisational  communication networks on the precondition that communication networks  and the communication environment are well managed. The nature of social  networks reveals that it will always be in existence where human interaction is  iii  present, however, communication management strategies are indeed  required to ensure that the quality of information disseminated over the social  network contribute to sound managerial outcomes. It was furthermore  established that communication management policies do not necessarily  affect individuals' experience of videoconferencing, however, as a  communication management tool, videoconferencing must be guided by  effective communication management policies and practises for the group to  be effective.","2003","2022-10-05 15:44:37","2022-10-05 15:44:37","2022-10-05 15:44:37","","","","","","","Videoconferencing as strategic management tool in new organisational forms","","","","","North-West University","","en","","Thesis","","","dspace.nwu.ac.za","","Accepted: 2009-02-04T10:32:06Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The consolidation of human and social capital within an organization using social media may have the ability to efficiently improve autonomy and professional development using the transformational learning process. This research focuses on the lived experiences of fourteen education professionals who use social media to communicate and collaborate, which has allowed for the discovery of the impact social media has on the following four primary themes, which emerged from the participant interviews: Communication and Collaboration Using Social Media, Solutions for Success, Building Relationships Using Social Media, and Professional Development Using Social Media. Social media was found to impact communication and collaboration between education professionals by providing users with a diversification of perspectives in the social system and provides a platform to allow all voices to be heard and 'levels the playing field' in order to achieve greater equality in the social system. Social media allows users to create a culture with balanced individual autonomy and collaborative work. Social media provides users with efficiencies in communication by organizing networks of specific groups of people, resources, and information. Social media allows users to build and maintain sustainable relationships, while allowing user the autonomy to choose who they connect with. Social media helps reduce social isolation by providing a mode of communication that engages the user in authentic and relevant dialogue with homogeneous colleagues on a global scale. Social media can be implemented by an individual on a grassroots level or on a large-scale organizational level, which are two vastly different approaches. Education professionals have the potential to be able to further develop professionally as they become intrinsically-motivated, transformational learners who are no longer socially isolated within their organization.","","2022-10-05 15:45:00","2022-10-05 15:45:00","2022-10-05 15:45:00","","248","","","","","Stop! collaborate and listen","","","","","Aurora University","United States -- Illinois","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781303881725","","","","","Collaboration; Communication; Education; Social media; Communication and the arts; Professional development; Relationships","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current measures scrutinize either local or global connectivity of the nodes and have been found to be inadequate for social networks. Ignoring hierarchy and community structure, which are inherent in all human social networks, is the primary cause of this inadequacy. Positional hierarchy and embeddedness of an actor in the community are intuitively crucial determinants of his importance. The theory of social capital asserts that an actor’s importance is derived from his position in network hierarchy as well as from the potential to mobilize resources through intra-community (bonding) and inter-community (bridging) ties. Inspired by this idea, we propose a novel centrality measure social centrality (SC) for actors in social networks. Our measure accounts for—(1) an individual’s propensity to socialize, and (2) his connections within and outside the community. These two factors are suitably aggregated to produce social centrality score. Comparative analysis of SC measure with classical and recent centrality measures using large public networks shows that it consistently produces more realistic ranking of nodes. The inference is based on the available ground truth for each tested networks. Extensive analysis of rankings delivered by SC measure and mapping with known facts in well-studied networks justifies its effectiveness in diverse social networks. Scalability evaluation of SC measure justifies its efficacy for real-world large networks.","2018-09-01","2022-10-05 15:45:06","2022-10-05 15:45:06","2022-10-05 15:45:06","1421-1443","","5","32","","Data Min Knowl Disc","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Centrality; Hierarchy; Social capital; Community; k-Truss decomposition; Strength of ties","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These “teams of teams” can be found in all areas of life, from business to medicine, science to the military. Accordingly, it is of great interest to determine how these systems function, and what makes a MTS successful. There are several elements which contribute to effective system functioning, including interactions across boundaries, information sharing interactions, and the development of team and MTS identification through repeated interactions. I argue that integrating networks and time into the study of MTSs can provide novel insights into each of these areas. To gain such a perspective, I introduce a new paradigm – the relational event framework – which allows me to develop and test hypotheses based on sequences of actions and interactions between members of a multiteam system. In this thesis, I pose four primary research questions: (1) how do communication patterns related to component team boundaries unfold, and what are the implications for team and MTS performance? (2) what aspects of information sharing are associated with effective MTS functioning, and how do successful teams transmit information over time? (3) how do members of a multiteam system dynamically expand or adapt their use of communication channels, and what implications do their decisions have for MTS performance? (4) how does a strong identification with the team and MTS coevolve with the interactions an individual has over time? To answer each of these questions, I developed a theoretical framework based on sequences of relational events and their relationships with outcomes. My research objective is to empirically test each hypothesis and derive insights into MTS functioning. To carry out this analysis, I employed a dataset from a laboratory environment to facilitate the collection of continuous interaction information. In total, I utilized a dataset comprised of 59 experimental sessions, each involving 20 participants organized into a MTS. Communication logs from each session were translated into sequences of relational events, which I then analyzed to test my proposed hypotheses. My findings suggest that temporal patterns of communication within- and between teams have implications for performance which vary at the team and MTS level. Further, I find that successful teams and MTSs are differentiated by their strategies for sharing information and selecting communication channels. Finally, an individual’s interactions can significantly shape how they identify with both their team and the system. Taken together, this thesis contributes to the extant literature by examining multiple facets of multiteam system functioning and determining the implications for performance. Furthermore, I advance the use of relational event models for studying group process, and provide extensions to the existing methods.","","2022-10-05 15:47:19","2022-10-05 15:47:19","2022-10-05 15:47:19","","238","","","","","It's About Time","","","","","Northwestern University","United States -- Illinois","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780355295399","","","","","Social sciences; Social networks; Teams; Multiteam systems; Applied sciences; Relational events; Virtuality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ecological conditions are expected to affect competition and thus the steepness of dominance hierarchies. This, in turn, may influence the value of the different currencies that primates exchange. Thus, it can be hypothesized that, as the dominance hierarchy becomes steeper, more grooming is directed up the hierarchy (in exchange for tolerance or agonistic support) and less grooming is exchanged for other grooming. We assembled a large database of within-group grooming distribution in primates (38 social groups belonging to 16 species and eight genera) and tested these hypotheses both within species (i.e. comparing different groups of the same species) and between species (using comparative methods that control for phylogenetic relatedness). We found within-species evidence that steeper dominance hierarchies were associated with more grooming being directed up the hierarchy, and that a trade-off occurred between the tendency to groom up the hierarchy and the degree of grooming reciprocation (although, in some analyses, only a nonsignificant trend was observed). By contrast, phylogenetically controlled comparisons between species did not reveal evidence of correlated evolution between the steepness of the dominance hierarchy, the tendency to direct grooming up the hierarchy, and the degree of grooming reciprocation.","2008-11-01","2022-10-05 15:47:44","2022-10-05 15:47:44","2022-10-05 15:47:44","439-446","","3","95","","Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","Trade-offs in primate grooming reciprocation","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Qualitative research methods, specifically case study design, concept mapping, and matrix analysis were used to collect and analyze the data from three firms. The findings from this investigation included 14 propositions that explain the associations between the variables and other factors found to affect implementation in the three companies, which were investigated. A new framework was developed from the propositions that further delineates the strategy implementation process. The framework introduces four additional variables found to be involved in the implementation process: life cycle stage of the firm, size and geographic dispersion of the firm, manager demographics, and training. Three primary context variables, organizational culture, organizational structure, and perceived environmental uncertainty; and three primary process variables, information processing, planning and control, and resource allocation were found to have a major effect on strategy implementation.

Even the provisioning of Internet security heavily relies on non-hierarchical, networked forms of organisation. Responses to large-scale botnets show the prevalence of networked governance and provide insight into its strengths and limitations. Networked governance can be defined as a semi-permanent, voluntary negotiation system that allows interdependent actors to opt for collaboration or unilateral action in the absence of an overarching authority. This chapter analyses the ability of traditional powerful actors such as state authorities and large enterprises to provide Internet security and exert power in the cyber-domain. The chapter outlines potential anchor points for traditional powerful actors to introduce more elements of hierarchy and control into Internet security provisioning networks. Empirically, the chapter describes emerging hybrids of networks and hierarchies in Internet security provisioning.","2014","2022-10-05 15:47:57","2022-10-05 15:47:57","2022-10-05 15:47:57","181-202","","","","","","Hierarchies in Networks","","","","","Springer","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-37481-4_11","","","","","National Security; Network Governance; Security Community; Security Company; Security Incident","Kremer, Jan-Frederik; Müller, Benedikt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, a large part of this literature exhibits a mechanistic understanding of communication that implies the possibility of a package-like transfer of information and meaning from sender to receiver. However, this notion of communication can be criticized for neglecting the constitutive role of communication for organizations. As an alternative, these authors propose a theoretical perspective known as “communication constitutes organizations” (CCO). The CCO view allows for grasping organizations as holistic and polyphonic communicative entities. Hence, what are the implications for CSR communication when we switch from a mechanistic to a constitutive notion of communication? Our application of the CCO view yields three main findings: (1) CSR communication represents only one of several communicative practices that collectively constitute the organization and that evolve in competition with one another; (2) CSR communication is not only a function of (large-scale) formal organizations, but as a communicative activity it can itself also form the constitutive basis for the emergence of rudimentary, local, and temporary forms of organizing; (3) According to the CCO view, organizations are constituted and stabilized by various non-human entities (e.g., texts or other artifacts) that “act” on their behalf. Thus, CSR communication would need to take also into account the agency and responsibility of these non-human entities, which in some cases lack concrete individual human creators who could be held accountable for. Taken together, our paper links the literature on CSR communication to broader debates in organizational communication studies. By applying the CCO view, we arrive at a new understanding of CSR communication that allows for comprehending the legitimacy and accountability of organizations as holistic communicative phenomena and helps to transcend a one-sided accentuation of the external side of CSR communication.","2011-12-01","2022-10-05 15:48:29","2022-10-05 15:48:29","2022-10-05 15:48:29","","","","","","","Transcending the Transmission Model","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","organizational communication; communication constitutes organizations (CCO); Corporate social responsibility (CSR); CSR communication; polyphony; social constructionism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1975785","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"SSGICHPU","thesis","2016","Schouten, ME","The Ups and Downs of Hierarchy. The causes and consequences of hierarchy struggles and positional loss","","","","","","Scholars have assumed that social hierarchies, the rank ordering of individuals with respect to a valued social dimension within a team, are stable over time. However, hierarchies change and the more changeable they are, the more likely they are to lead to conflicts and have other negative interpersonal consequences. In this dissertation, I examine both the ups and the downs of hierarchy. Focusing on how and why people go up the hierarchy, I conducted a qualitative study of Dutch politicians to explore what drives them to engage in hierarchy struggles, or competitions for more influence within their teams. Contrary to previous research, which has focused on two forms of hierarchy struggles, my results suggest that three distinct forms of hierarchy struggles exist – power, status, and leadership struggles. Power struggles are about increasing control over valued resources, while status struggles are about increasing one’s respect and admiration in the eyes of others. Leadership struggles are about increasing one’s influence to better advance collective goals. In subsequent studies I develop scales to measure these constructs and to replicate the tri-partite structure of hierarchy struggles distinguishing them from other types of conflict. I then leverage these studies to build a conceptual model focused on how, why, and when team members engage in a hierarchy struggle with other team members to climb the hierarchy and how other team members likely respond to these. Finally, in examining the downs of hierarchy, I focus on the different nature of losing power versus losing status. I argue and demonstrate that losing status is more painful and has greater intra- and interpersonal consequences than losing power. Together, the studies and model presented in this dissertation offer an in-depth exploration of the changeable nature of hierarchy and suggest that the changing nature of social hierarchies can be a source of contention and has significant implications for within-team dynamics.","2016-06-02","2022-10-05 15:49:24","2022-10-05 15:49:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rotterdam","","","Doctoral Thesis","","","Erasmus University Rotterdam","","ISBN: 9789058924438","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to show that evaluation is necessary, appropriate, and desirable in rhetorical criticism, an examination of critical theory from antiquity to the present was made. It was shown that rhetorical criticism should be thought of as the knowledgeable formulation and expression of pronouncements upon the use of symbols, verbal and nonverbal, to influence human thoughts and/or actions in order to increase the understanding of the human condition and to raise the standards of artistry. The grounds upon which rhetoric should be evaluated were revealed. A justification for applying criteria of effects, ethics, artistry, and social value was offered. A critique of the social satire rhetoric of Lenny Bruce illustrated the possibility of applying the four evaluative criteria. Evaluation revealed the quality, worth, soundness, and desirability of Bruce's discourse, a revelation impossible in so-called ""non-evaluative"" criticism.","","2022-10-05 15:49:46","2022-10-05 15:49:46","2022-10-05 15:49:46","","132","","","","","Evaluation in Rhetorical Criticism","","","","","Temple University","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798644972487","","","","","Communication and the arts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The theoretical basis for this analysis comes from Bourdieu’s theory of practice, explaining the relationship between individual actions and dispositions, the social setting they are in, and the use of his four forms of capital during the interaction. This thesis walks through the production of norms and dispositions of individuals when playing video games, producing their overall habitus in the space. This is followed by analysis of the virtual field of video games, looking at the design and development of these games, the relationship with the video game community at large and the importance of hierarchy and structure on producing a virtual field of interaction between players. The final chapter breaks down the four major forms of capital outlined by Bourdieu (economic, cultural, social and symbolic) with the fourth being adjusted as a new term, gaming capital, as a representation of the combination of the other three forms when engaging in video game play. The results of this research point to the exponential opportunities for video games to facilitate social and civic engagement, as well as producing varying forms of capital that can be used both within the context of the virtual world and the real one.","2021","2022-10-05 15:50:16","2022-10-05 15:50:16","2022-10-05 15:50:16","","139","","","","","","","","","","Illinois State University","United States -- Illinois","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.S.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798460479818","","","","","Cooperation; Civic engagement; Gaming capital; Habitus; Immersion; Social field","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to understand this disparity, men’s attitudes toward seeking psychological help have been examined in relation to men’s gender role constructs.  Men’s conformity to traditional masculine gender role norms has been negatively associated with attitudes toward seeking psychological help (Good, Dell, & Mintz, 1989; Good et al., 2006).  Men’s gender role conflict, or the negative intrapersonal conflict that results when men rigidly adhere to traditional gender roles, has also been negatively associated with help-seeking attitudes (see O’Neil, 2005, for a review).  However, the relation of men’s gender role identity to gender role ideology and help-seeking attitudes has been largely ignored.  The present study examined the relation of two dimensions of gender role identity: gender role exploration and gender role commitment (Marcia, 1966), to men’s gender role conflict and psychological help-seeking attitudes.     Participants were 191 male college students, ranging in age from 18 to 58 years (M=24; SD=6.26). The sample was ethnically diverse, with 43.5% Caucasian/White participants, 20.4% Latino/Hispanic participants, 22% Asian American/Asian/Pacific Islander participants, 8.9% Black/African American participants, and 5.2% who identified as multiracial or “other.” Most participants had never engaged in psychological treatment, per self-report (78%).  Measures included a demographic questionnaire, the Gender Role Conflict Scale (O’Neil, Helms, Gable, David, & Wrightsman, 1986), which assessed gender role conflict four domains (i.e., success, power and competition, restrictive emotionality, restrictive affectionate behavior between men, and conflict between work and family), the Gender Role Exploration and Commitment Scale (Schwartz et al., 2012), which assessed gender role identity, the Inventory of Attitudes toward Seeking Mental Health Services (Mackenzie, Knox, Gekoski, & Macaulay, 2004), which measured attitudes toward psychological help-seeking, and Conformity to Masculine Norms-46 (Parent & Moradi, 2009), which measured conformity to traditional role norms.     The present study examined four research questions:  (1) To what extent are gender role exploration and commitment scores related to levels of gender role conflict domains, when controlling for conformity to masculine role norms?  (2) To what extent do gender role exploration and commitment moderate the relation between conformity to masculine role norms and gender role conflict domains? (3) What is the combined and unique contribution of gender role exploration, gender role commitment and four gender role conflict domains to attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help, when controlling for conformity to masculine role norms? (4) To what extent do gender role commitment and exploration moderate the relationship between the four gender role conflict domains and attitudes toward psychological help-seeking?      Results suggest that, after controlling for men’s conformity to masculine role norms, gender role commitment was predictive of men’s gender role conflict in the areas of success, power, and competition and conflict between work and family, and was a protective factor for restrictive emotionality.  Gender role exploration was not a significant predictor of gender role conflict, and neither gender role exploration nor commitment significantly moderated the relation of conformity to male role norms and gender role conflict. Results also indicated that conformity to masculine role norms was a better predictor of men’s negative attitudes about therapy than gender role conflict, gender role exploration, or gender role commitment.  When controlling for previous therapy experience and conformity to masculine role norms, neither gender role conflict, gender role exploration nor gender role commitment were significant predictors of men’s help-seeking attitudes. Results also indicated that there was a weak interaction effect between gender role commitment and gender role conflict, when predicting men’s attitudes toward help-seeking.","2013-08","2022-10-05 15:50:26","2022-10-05 15:50:26","2022-10-05 15:50:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","The author of this work is the copyright owner.

This manuscript proposes that reintroductions suffer from a narrow focus on biological and technical considerations and introduces a more holistic reintroduction paradigm which includes biological/technical, valuational, and organizational variables. Variables from each classes were analyzed for a proposed black-footed ferret reintroduction in Montana. Evidence from the reintroduction literature and ferret case study support the contention that most reintroductions narrowly focus on biological/technical considerations to the exclusion of important valuational and organizational concerns. However, the significance of these findings to reintroduction success rates could not be ascertained. Several important results were obtained from case study analyses. Examination of biological/technical considerations included analyses of ferret predator and prey populations. Populations of most potential predators were generally low and relatively stable or declining and black-tailed prairie dog prey populations were increasing, although at decreasing rates. These results bode well for the proposed reintroduction. Valuational considerations were studied using interviews and a sample survey. Local residents, especially ranchers, opposed the proposed reintroduction and were antagonistic toward ferrets due to real and perceived threats to agricultural practices, lifestyles, and livelihoods. Greater knowledge did not lead to more favorable attitudes. Education programs should strive to change or neutralize opposition and increase support using persuasion, purchase, and pressure. A preliminary analysis of organizational variables was performed using interviews, published material, and personal observation. Key actor behavior and program performance were influenced by differential resources, fragmented authority, poor leadership, the characteristics of special groups, goal displacement, conflicting ideologies, and multiple measures of program success. Improvements are possible with greater use of special groups, clarification of authorities, leadership, and goals, and early recognition and resolution of conflicts. To increase chances for success, reintroduction programs should address the biological/technical, valuational, and organizational dimensions of the reintroduction challenge.","","2022-10-05 15:52:13","2022-10-05 15:52:13","2022-10-05 15:52:13","","578","","","","","Toward an endangered species reintroduction paradigm","","","","","Yale University","United States -- Connecticut","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798208432105","","","","","Social sciences; Biological sciences; Montana","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The chief means of accomplishing this goal is the use of both the core narrative and of the primary social-symbolic relationships of the letter so that the motif of unity acts as a rhetorical “mask,” which helps to promote the hierarchical design of the household table. The narrative construct features the dramatic rendering of the creation myth of the church, climaxing in the unity of Jews and Gentiles under the headship of Christ. This unity, as well as that of the cosmos in subjection to Christ, forms the central social-symbolic relationships. First narrative and then social criticism, following the model of Norman R. Petersen, are employed to explore the telling of the myth and the use of the social-symbolic relationships, while rhetorical criticism is the vehicle for examining how these elements combine to make a cohesive argument. The final chapter of the dissertation is a womanist exploration of the continuing impact of Ephesians 5:21–33. Although the social setting of this epistle will no doubt remain elusive, this dissertation offers an alternative approach to its reconstruction, using the study of the epistle's rhetorical design grounded in narrative and social criticism.","","2022-10-05 15:52:20","2022-10-05 15:52:20","2022-10-05 15:52:20","","282","","","","","Together, not equal","","","","","Union Theological Seminary","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780599309388","","","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Ephesians (Epistle to the); Headship; Paul; Rhetoric; Saint; Unity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Study goals were to examine (a) how parenting a difficult child is associated with maternal moods; (b) how maternal moods may be associated with coparenting and the presence of the father; and (c) whether these patterns differ in families with a child diagnosed with ADHD versus comparison families. Analyses explored the dyadic mother-child and mother-spouse interactions as well as triadic mother-child-spouse interactions. Specifically, mothers' moods were examined when they were interacting with their child in the presence versus absence of their spouse. The framework for this study was taken from family systems theory and the belief that an individual cannot be fully understood without considering the surrounding systems. This study used data collected from two groups of mothers (42 mothers of a school-age child with ADHD and 51 comparison mothers) across a 1-week period. Mothers completed electronic diaries every 30±6 minutes during nonschool hours, resulting in a total of 8,613 observations across days and participants. Diaries assessed maternal moods, social contexts, child behaviors, and the perceived quality of mother-child interactions. Results corroborated previous findings of increased difficulty for mothers of children with ADHD. These mothers reported more distress and anger, less positive mood, and worse mother-child interaction quality than comparison mothers. Adjusting for weekend/weekday and activities, spouse presence was associated with less maternal distress and more maternal positive mood, but only among mothers of children with ADHD. Across both groups, mothers reported more anger when they were with versus without their child. Spouse presence was associated with improvements in the perceived quality of mother-child interactions. Maternal distress, anger, and positive mood fluctuated in the expected directions with child misbehavior, and mothers' moods were less reactive to child oppositionality when the spouse was present versus absent. Findings demonstrate the benefits of fathers' involvement and suggest that mothers of children with ADHD may have a greater need for spousal support than comparison mothers, due in part to the increased burden of parenting a child with ADHD.","","2022-10-05 15:52:41","2022-10-05 15:52:41","2022-10-05 15:52:41","","107","","","","","And Father Makes Three","","","","","University of California, Irvine","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781267821942","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology; Mood; Adhd; Coparenting; Ecological momentary assessment; Family system; Mother","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early modern critique of hierarchy with its political edge often dominates understanding of the notion, but such critique stems from medieval controversies over religious perfection and sacramental life, which in turn echo the monastic polemics of Pseudo‐Dionysius, the probable inventor of the term hierarchy. The massive influence of Dionysius made him a contested authority in Thomas's time, and in his battles with secular clergy the Dominican theologian shows himself a more careful interpreter of the pseudo‐Areopagite than his contemporaries, who purported to defend hierarchy against the mendicants.

The enormous quantity of tableware indicates ritualization of meals to the exclusion of others (implying strong social boundaries), a practice that is common among elite groups. Resistance is manifested in the animal bone deposits which attest to meat consumption as a sacred ritual. Resistance is also expressed by the distinctive and identical mode of burial. Social hierarchy and ritualization are indicated by ritual baths with multiple partitions. Several rings may also indicate the presence of women. In conclusion, the rituals and resistance are consistent with sectarian ideology. The connection between the inhabitants of kh.

We elucidate the properties of the ground state configuration to give a concise definition of communities as cohesive subgroups in networks that is adaptive to the specific class of network under study. Further, we show how hierarchies and overlap in the community structure can be detected. Computationally efficient local update rules for optimization procedures to find the ground state are given. We show how the ansatz may be used to discover the community around a given node without detecting all communities in the full network and we give benchmarks for the performance of this extension.

Specifically, the maximum pairwise likelihood (MPL) estimator is investigated in multilevel probit models where it is computationally easy to obtain. The asymptotic efficiency of the MPL estimator versus the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is investigated in two particular models and the issue of weighting the log PL is examined as well. A simulation study was further conducted to compare MPL to ML and PQL2 estimators. An illustration of the MPL estimation method is presented in the context of surrogate endpoint validation. We use the methodology developed by Buyse et al. (2000) for two normally distributed endpoints, where the surrogate validation issue is approached from a meta-analytic standpoint and studied at each of two levels (individual and trial levels), and we propose an extension to the case of two binary endpoints. This approach entails fitting of a three-level probit model for which MPL estimation is well suited. An extension of the standard multilevel probit model is also discussed for modeling of longitudinal binary outcomes. Using a latent variable model formulation, the (latent) error terms are assumed to be realizations of a stationary Gaussian process with some autocorrelation function, which affords a possible way of correcting for residual correlation left in the data even after correction for fixed and random effects. Although ML estimation is impractical with this model, MPL is straightforward to use. The model is used to estimate reliability in clinical trial data with longitudinal binary outcomes. Finally, we examine the surrogate endpoint validation issue when a longitudinally measured biomarker is considered as a surrogate for a time-to-event endpoint. To extend the approach of Buyse et al. (2000), we need to formulate a joint model for longitudinal measurements and event time data. To this end, the model of Henderson, Diggle and Dobson (2000) is adopted. It is shown how trial- and individual-level surrogacy measures can be adapted in this context and clinical trial data in advanced prostate cancer are used to evaluate the usefulness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level as a surrogate for survival.","","2022-10-05 15:55:48","2022-10-05 15:55:48","2022-10-05 15:55:48","","160","","","","","","","","","","Limburgs Universitair Centrum (Belgium)","Belgium","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493769042","","","","","Pure sciences; Biological sciences; Binary responses; Longitudinal data; Multilevel models; Surrogate endpoints","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To answer this research question, we develop literature-based hypotheses and collect data from 4316 agreements of mergers and acquisitions and alliances and joint venture announced and completed between 2000 and 2010 by 88 of the first 100-ranked members of the Fortune 500 in the year 2000. We then test the hypotheses through a binary logistic regression model. This study brings interesting results and findings in terms of how and why production management considerations should play a crucial role in the type of strategic decisions that are usually reserved for finance and strategy managers.

The methods of multiple analysis of variance and structural equation modeling were used to evaluate five research questions and nineteen hypotheses. Overall, no differences were found between the types of subordinate officer surveyed for the constructs of interest. However, it was found that subordinates and their commanders view their relationships differently. Commanders reported higher responses for LMX and mentoring effectiveness that did not correlate with their subordinates responses, suggesting that the relationship between commanders and their subordinates needs to be strengthened. The research also revealed that subordinate officers felt average to slightly positive about the LMX, POS, perceived opportunities for promotion, job satisfaction, affective commitment, and intent to remain in the Air Force.

The robes are thus imbued with the wisdom of the Buddha. Indian monastic codes distinguished between the ascetic practice of wearing robes made from discarded rags picked up from the road, and the monastic practice of wearing robes made from donated cloth. As Buddhism spread, robes were adapted to different cultures, often with minimal reference to monastic codes. The history of this adaptation in Japan, the subject of this research, is revealed by investigating examples of garments, depictions of robes in Buddhist art, and a rich literary tradition about the spiritual power of the robe. The form of both rag robes and monastic robes changed in East Asia. Robes sewn from colorful pieces of fabric imitated robes made of discarded rags. In Japan, such robes were used in rituals for the preservation of the state, given as gifts to the monarch, and preserved at the treasury of the eighth century monarch, Shōmu and other temples. Portraits of eminent Buddhist teachers depict them wearing these multi-colored robes. The monastic robe also changed as Buddhist clerics at court were required to wear robes in the color of their court rank rather than the subdued colors prescribed by monastic codes. Seventeenth century reformers attempted to reshape Japanese Buddhist robes to fit the prescriptions of ancient monastic codes. The Shingon Buddhist teacher, Jiun Onkō, supplemented this kind of textual study by examining art and ancient robes. He taught his followers to make monastic robes according to the codes, and robes that he identified as ""rag robes,"" using the ancient multi-colored pieced robes preserved in Japan as a model. The monastic and rag robes made by Jiun's followers inspired the twentieth century Sōtō Zen priest, Sawaki Kōdō, to popularize sewing robes. Following the teachings of Dōgen, the founder of Sōtō Zen, Sawaki encouraged lay and ordained men and women to sew and wear their own robes as a return to fundamental Buddhist practice, an approach at odds with the customs of Sōtō Zen. The interdisciplinary approach of this dissertation reveals the dynamic interplay between text, art, and textiles that created a vibrant material culture of Japanese Buddhist vestments.","","2022-10-05 16:13:10","2022-10-05 16:13:10","2022-10-05 16:13:10","","337","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Los Angeles","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781124558721","","","","","Social sciences; Japan; Philosophy; religion and theology; Buddhism; Dogen; Jiun Onko; Kesa; Robes; Sawaki Kodo; Vestments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Each year, more than 2 million men and women have access to modern contraceptive methods in Colombia. However, amid the pandemic, disruptions in supply chains, the interruption of essential services for sexual and reproductive health, and social inequalities may jeopardize these gains in contraception among Venezuelan migrants and refugees. The measurement of inequalities focuses on identifying the epicenter of inequity that is particularly relevant within the humanitarian response under strain. The objective of this article is to identify inequalities in access to contraception services among the migrant and refugee populations in six cities that concentrate 70% of the Venezuelan migration into Colombia and to discuss the challenges they represent for future emergencies. Methods and findings We used a cross-sectional, descriptive study that included a mixed research approach (quantitative and qualitative analyses) based on three activities: i) analysis of contraceptive care records for the period 2018–2019; ii) measurement of inequalities in access to contraceptive services, and iii) design and implementation of twelve focus groups among Venezuelan migrants and refugees for discussion. Results Despite the evidence of a 70% increase in the use of contraceptive services among Venezuelan migrants between 2018 and 2019, there are absolute and relative inequalities in access to contraceptive methods both in the migrant and refugee populations versus the host population. The inequalities are mainly explained by the demographic dependency rate and the lack of job opportunities. Conclusions The provision of essential sexual and reproductive health services to migrant and host populations must be regular, continuous, and shielded so that under no circumstances is it interrupted neither for infectious disease outbreaks to climate change emergencies in the future.","2021-01-01","2022-10-05 16:13:22","2022-10-05 16:13:22","2022-10-05 16:13:22","100027","","","3","","Journal of Migration and Health","Venezuelan migrants and access to contraception in Colombia","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","COVID-19; Contraception; Inequities; Migrants; Sexual and reproductive health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, the existent systems of thought are hierarchically organized. This dissertation presents a schema of five subject positions that initiates occupy as they enter into any hierarchical discourse system. These positions are submission, bluff, resistance, flight, and negotiation. The application of this schema focuses on the role of students as initiates in the composition classroom. Taking examples from the literature of the discipline, this dissertation provides a meta-analysis that illustrates the benefits and consequences of each specific subject position and identifies the ways in which initiates both position themselves and are positioned by the discourse. Thus, students learn to approach hierarchies as structures whose organization and goals are repetitive. Instead of finding herself repeatedly positioned or repeatedly choosing the same subject position, the initiate is provided a wider range of action. Drawing upon classical rhetoric, this dissertation applies stasis theory as a method of inquiry that prompts negotiation. In terms of pedagogic practice, the significant contribution of this dissertation is an awareness of subject positions as well as strategies by which the skilled rhetor can help students move from subject positions of submission, bluff, and resistance into a position of negotiation.","","2022-10-05 16:13:33","2022-10-05 16:13:33","2022-10-05 16:13:33","","260","","","","","","","","","","Texas A&M University","United States -- Texas","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493467894","","","","","Language; literature and linguistics; Initiate positions; Rhetorical systems; Subject positions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The management of IT-business alignment is especially pertinent to academia, particularly in terms of not only success but survival as well. The primary purpose of this research study was to validate the alignment maturity of higher education institutions in the United States compared to the overall industry average reported in “An Update on Business-IT Alignment: “A Line” Has Been Drawn,” by J. Luftman and R. Kempaiah, 2007, MIS Quarterly Executive, 6(3), 165-177. The chief problem this research study addressed was IT-business alignment maturity in higher education institutions in hopefulness that the IT and business leaders may identify and focus their attentions on the key alignment issues. To assess IT-business alignment maturity, Dr. Luftman’s original survey instrument was self-administered to technology and business leaders of accredited higher education institutions located in the United States. The survey measured the six constructs of communications, competency, governance, partnership, technology scope, and skills. The findings of this research study, supported by statistical evidence, suggest that the higher education industry does demonstrate a lower IT-business alignment average than the industry average reported as reported by Dr. Luftman and Dr. Kempaiah. However, the research findings of this research study also suggest that the higher education industry has shown a 50.88% increase in IT-business alignment maturity.","","2022-10-05 16:13:44","2022-10-05 16:13:44","2022-10-05 16:13:44","","119","","","","","The relationship between information technology maturity and business alignment in higher education","","","","","Capella University","United States -- Minnesota","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781321917338","","","","","Social sciences; Higher education; Education; Applied sciences; Information technology; Alignment maturity; Information technology-business alignment; Organizational management; Strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NNT5DQLV","thesis","2013","Robertson, Craig","Singing to be Normal: Tracing the Behavioural Influence of Music in Conflict Transformation","","","","","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/14684","Music is often heralded as a means of bringing people together or celebrating diversity and therefore it is also often assumed that music can be a beneficial tool in conflict transformation settings. Despite this widespread belief there is little empirical evidence to support this notion. Indeed, there is more evidence that suggests the opposite; music can increase solidarity within one group but that very process strengthens the borders between what is accepted as in-group or out-group. It is this strengthening of identity borders that can lead to outright conflict if certain other social conditions prevail. One question remains, why is the belief in the power of music so widespread when there is evidence that demonstrates potential negative outcomes? In order to address that question, it is useful to observe that music continues to be used in community projects and within NGOs as a means to bond groups in social conflict despite the lack evidence to support their actions. The belief in the positive power of music has influenced behaviour so that musical activity is included in peace work. Indeed, belief can be seen as a prime motivator of behaviour in most sectors of the world, much more so than hard evidence. This thesis is an exploration of the social processes that occur in musical experiences that affect memory, identity and emotions and how they affect understanding and belief which in turn affects group behaviour. The research is inter-disciplinary, drawing on music sociology, social movements, cultural studies, ethno-musicology and conflict theory, and data was collected using qualitative methods (ethnographic interviewing, action research, observation/participation, grounded theory). The fieldwork was conducted with an inter-religious choir in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a comparative study conducted with a world-music community choir in London, UK.","2013-05-15","2022-10-05 16:14:05","2022-10-05 16:14:10","2022-10-05 16:14:05","","","","","","","Singing to be Normal","","","","","","","en","","","","","ore.exeter.ac.uk","","Accepted: 2014-03-25T13:39:38Z Publisher: University of Exeter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"7LUI3SB5","thesis","","Robichau, Robbie Waters","Between Markets and Government: Essays on Nonprofitness and the Institutional Transformation of Child Welfare Agencies","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1424275199/abstract/1BABEFB9FB854345PQ/1","In many respects, the current public child welfare system closely resembles that of over 100 years ago. Then, as well as now, nonprofit child welfare agencies are the critical providers of service delivery to vulnerable children and their families. Contemporary nonprofits, however, are confronted with social and fiscal pressures to conform to normative practices and behaviors of governmental and for-profit organizations. Simultaneously, these agencies may also feel compelled to behave in accordance with a nonprofit normative ethic. Yet, scholars and practitioners are often unaware of how these different forces may be shaping the practices of child welfare agencies and, the nonprofit sector in general. This multi-paper dissertation examines how managerial and organizational practices of child welfare nonprofits are influenced business, government, and other nonprofit organizations and the extent to which processes process of institutional isomorphism in child welfare nonprofits are happening. Data was collected from a national ample of 184 child welfare administrators to explore marketization practices, collaboration behaviors, and managerial priorities of these agencies. Multinomial logistic, ordered logistic, and ordinary least squares regression, and historical analysis help shed light on the contemporary practices of these agencies. The results reveal that these agency's behaviors are shaped by government control, influences from the business community, identification with a nonprofit mindset (i.e., nonprofitness), funding streams, and various other factors. One key finding is that identification with a nonprofit mindset encourages certain behaviors like collaboration with other nonprofits and placing greater importance on key managerial priorities, but it does not reduce the likelihood of adopting business management strategies. Another important finding is that government control and funding does not have as strong as an influence on child welfare nonprofits as expected; however, influence from the business community does strongly affect many of their practices.

Sustainability of land resources has  become a central issue since the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. A better  understanding of the processes and patterns of land cover change will aid urban planners and  decision makers in guiding more environmentally conscious development. The objective of  this study was firstly, to determine the location and extent of land use and land cover changes  in the uMhlathuze municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa between 1992 and 2002, and  secondly, to predict the likely expansion of urban areas for the year 2012. The uMhlathuze  municipality has experienced rapid urban growth since 1976 when the South African Ports and  Railways Administration built a deep water harbour at Richards Bay, a town within the  municipality. Three Landsat satellite images were obtained for the years, 1992, 1997 and  2002. These images were classified into six classes representing the dominant land covers in  the area. A post classification change detection technique was used to determine the extent and  location of the changes taking place during the study period. Following this, a GIS-based land  cover change suitability model, GEOMOD2, was used to determine the likely distribution of  urban land cover in the year 2012. The model was validated using the 2002 image. Sugarcane  was found to expand by 129% between 1992 and 1997. Urban land covers increased by an  average of 24%, while forestry and woodlands decreased by 29% between 1992 and 1997.  Variation in rainfall on the study years and diversity in sugarcane growth states had an impact  on the classification accuracy. Overall accuracy in the study was 74% and the techniques gave  a good indication of the location and extent of changes taking place in the study site, and show  much promise in becoming a useful tool for regional planners and policy makers.","2005","2022-10-05 16:14:35","2022-10-05 16:14:38","2022-10-05 16:14:35","","","","","","","An assessment of land cover changes using GIS and remote sensing","","","","","","","en","","","","","researchspace.ukzn.ac.za","","Accepted: 2011-08-24T11:28:33Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"GUQNN962","thesis","","Roddick, Andrew Paul","Communities of pottery production and consumption on the Taraco Peninsula, Bolivia, 200 BC-300 AD","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/755680431/abstract/C1B3E9E3820F44A5PQ/1","This dissertation examines Late Formative Period (200 BC-300 AD) communities of potting practice at the three settlements of Kala Uyuni, Kumi Kipa and Sonaji on the Taraco Peninsula, of the Lake Titicaca Basin, Bolivia. Ceramics play a central role in defining the social boundaries of prehistoric communities in the region. However our current narratives are stymied for the Late Formative Period, which precedes the appearance of the urban center of Tiwanaku (AD 400-950). This is partly due to a reliance on ceramic design style. This study develops a practice-oriented approach to define Taraco Peninsula technological styles, refine the local ceramic chronology and evaluate the relationship between Late Formative communities and pottery. A “communities of practice” approach (Lave and Wenger 1991), which stresses the social entanglements between learning and identity, drives the analysis of the subtle changes in production sequences and their related consumption practices. Pottery production and consumption at Kala Uyuni, Kumi Kipa and Sonaji were analyzed through attribute analysis, petrography, x-ray fluorescence and x-ray diffraction. Shifts in learned bodily practice, such as surface finishing techniques, and a suite of new technological choices, including paste preparation, define both the transition to the Late Formative Period and internal sub-phases. These technological choices were likely linked to a larger symbolic landscape and embedded in a greater productive taskscape. The spatial context of production tools suggests that pottery was manufacture in all three settlements. A survey of the local hills found that potters likely used local clays, while petrography showed that tempers were added and may have been collected further afield. The similarity in operational sequences and paste recipes indicates that Taraco potters were a single learning community and part of their identities were likely constituted through their skillful potting practice. Consumption patterns changed slightly through the Middle and Late Formative, with an increased use of deep bowl forms. Large-scale political feasting, essential to the urban experience at Tiwanaku, was not a central social practice. Rather particular forms had multi-purpose functions, framing special events. This research contributes to social archaeologies of community, research on craft production and archaeological theories of practice.","","2022-10-05 16:15:17","2022-10-05 16:15:17","2022-10-05 16:15:16","","539","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Berkeley","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781124178066","","","","","Social sciences; Bolivia; Communities; Ceramics; Andes; Formative period; Pottery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has continued to do business as usual. A major challenge of public education today is to prepare our students to compete successfully in the world marketplace. All children must receive a quality education regardless of their place of residence or parents' income. Total Quality Management's philosophy believes that both the external (parents and community) and internal customers (the students) are to be provided with products and services of ever-improving quality. The Total Quality Management accepts feedback from all stakeholders to define quality and utilizes empowered and well trained employees to develop the processes necessary for quality. The purpose of this study was to explore the extent of Total Quality Management practices in Maricopa County Public Schools. The second purpose was to determine if Total Quality Management practices have an impact on public schools in the following areas: (1) strategic planning, (2) data analysis, (3) staff training, (4) faculty and staff involvement, (5) employee satisfaction, (6) student involvement, (7) evaluation of services, (8) customer satisfaction, (9) student achievement. The study found that one of the 56 public school districts in Maricopa County was implementing Total Quality Management practices. Based on the data, there was a significant difference between teachers' perceptions in a Total Quality School versus teachers in a non Total Quality School in all nine surveyed areas. The implementation of Total Quality Management practices brings about an awareness of the district's mission statement and the development of strategic objectives. Data is used to analyze program effectiveness. Initial and ongoing staff training is essential for Total Quality Management practices to thrive and maintain a level of continuous improvement. Faculty and staff are empowered by leadership to evaluate and solve problems, as well as, provide input on curriculum decisions. Total Quality Management teachers report high morale and job satisfaction. Students are aware of their learning outcomes and are able to assess their accomplishments. Evaluation of services is carried out by the faculty so they can identify unacceptable variances in programs and create interventions to remedy them. New services are evaluated to ensure they are obtaining the desired results. Customer satisfaction is determined by surveying students, parents and high schools as well as looking at the learning needs of the students. Student Achievement on standardized tests was improving in addition to students meeting teachers' expectations in speaking/listening, reading, writing, mathematics. Students were also developing positive personal and interpersonal relationships, higher order thinking skills, and problem solving strategies. In summary, the nine Total Quality Management areas have a positive impact on school improvement.","","2022-10-05 16:15:38","2022-10-05 16:15:38","2022-10-05 16:15:38","","154","","","","","","","","","","Arizona State University","United States -- Arizona","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780599086364","","","","","Education; Applied sciences; Elementary schools; Teacher; Total Quality Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An implicit hierarchical character of the yin-yang opposition is generally assumed, but rarely analyzed. In this article an attempt is made to reconsider the Western view of yang (correlated with heaven, life, male, etc.) to be the superior value. Fieldwork of the author in South Korea revealed that the superior value in the sacred realm is linked with ŭm, i. e., the yin (earth, death, female, etc.). As urn and yang form a whole, the world of the dead (ŭm) and the world of the living (yang) form the whole of the social cosmos. This ""whole"" is symbolized by an eternal reciprocity between dead parents and ritual heirs. Ŭm-yang links are exposed while analyzing time and space symbolism of rituals for the dead which are held either in the house or at the grave, or both in the house and at the grave. The author suggests that a new model reconciling Needham's dualism and Dumont's hierarchy could be developed.","1994","2022-10-05 16:16:29","2022-10-05 16:16:29","2022-10-05 16:16:29","471-491","","4/6","89","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Anthropos Institut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These polities, however, emerged from local traditions of mobility, multiresource pastoralism, and distributed forms of hierarchy and administrative control that represent important alternative pathways in the comparative study of early states and empires. The review of evidence from 15 polities illustrates long traditions of political and administrative organization that derive from the steppe, with Bronze Age origins well before 200 B.C.

Rooted in the definition of organizational corruption as misuse of power or position for personal or organizational gain, this work suggests that organizational corruption is driven by the individual and institutional tendency to structure societies as group-based social hierarchies. SDT describes a series of factors and processes across multiple levels of analysis that systemically contribute to the initiation and maintenance of social hierarchies and associated power inequalities, favoritism, and discrimination. I posit that the same factors and processes also contribute to individuals’ lower awareness of the misuse of power and position within the social hierarchies, leading to the initiation and maintenance of organizational corruption. Specifically, individuals high in social dominance orientation, believing that they belong to superior groups, are likely to be less aware of corruption because of their feeling of entitlement to greater power and their desire to maintain dominance even if that requires exploiting others. Members of subordinate groups are also likely to have lower awareness of corruption if they show more favoritism toward dominant group members to enhance their sense of worth and preserve social order. Institutions contribute to lower awareness of corruption by developing and enforcing structures, norms, and practices that promote informational ambiguity and maximize focus on dominance and promotion. Dynamic coordination among individuals and institutions is ensured through the processes of person-environment fit and legitimizing beliefs, ideologies, or rationalizations.","2012-12-01","2022-10-05 16:17:25","2022-10-05 16:17:25","2022-10-05 16:17:25","237-251","","2","111","","J Bus Ethics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Power; Hierarchy; Inequality; Institutions; Awareness; Legitimizing myth; Organizational corruption; Outgroup favoritism; Person-environment fit; Social dominance orientation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the microlevel, racial domination is reproduced through social interactions. In this article, I draw on Erving Goffman?s dramaturgical approach to social interaction to illuminate the development of the racialized interaction order whereby actors racialized as white impose a set of implicit rules and underlying assumptions onto interracial interactions. I examine archetypal instances of racialized social interactions in America?s history and present-day to reveal the role of social interactions in racially structuring social institutions and everyday lives. First, I discuss the development and racialization of chattel slavery and its routinization as an interaction order. Next, I explore the dramaturgical and symbolic significance of the postbellum emergence and spread of racial terrorism such as white lynch mobs. I then analyze the contemporary discursive and performative strategies of white racial dominance and aspects of the contemporary racialized interaction order such as the de facto racialization of spatial boundaries, mass media and the digital sphere, and police violence. I conclude by discussing the significance of interactional analysis for understanding the present racialized social system.","2017-05-01","2022-10-05 16:17:30","2022-10-05 16:17:30","2022-10-05 16:17:30","158-181","","2","41","","","Dramaturgical Domination","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This theory shifts the primary focal point of leadership discussions from vertical to lateral forms of influence. Moreover, it has been recognized that the shared leadership environment requires a unique understanding of identity. Working in teams that allow for lateral forms of influence requires that members have both a bounded and open understanding of identity.     This research examines the association between trinitarian thinking and the understanding of personal identity in the context of positions of lateral influence. In particular the doctrines of the image of God, union with Christ, and covenant are examined from a trinitarian perspective. Because the doctrine of Trinity emphasizes that the one God eternally exists as three persons, trinitarian thinking requires that both universals and particulars be held together in an equiprimal relationship. Each of these doctrines is examined in order to highlight the significance of this equiprimal relationship in understanding personal identity.    In the concluding chapters of this research, a model of leadership is proposed that values both the bounded and open aspects of personal identity. This model encourages the development of ethical lateral influence through love, dialogue, and a covenantal understanding of authority. These three aspects of ethical lateral influence are then applied to the workgroup setting through the development of a particular organizational culture. In order for a culture that values love, dialogue, and covenantal relationships to develop, organizations must build observable patterns of teamwork, diversification, and coaching.","2015-03-31","2022-10-05 16:17:39","2022-10-05 16:17:42","2022-10-05 16:17:39","","","","","","","The Trinitarian Foundation of Leadership","","","","","","","en","","","","","repository.sbts.edu","","Accepted: 2015-03-31T13:49:26Z Publisher: Southern Baptist Theological Seminary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays these players are augmenting their services from simple intermediation to include new inter-organizational relationships. The interest of this paper is to investigate the shift in the role and evolution of services proposed by e-marketplaces in response to the demands of the market participants. We carried out a longitudinal qualitative field study of an e-marketplace providing the outsourcing of the procurement process. Through the study of services evolving over time we show that, as marketplaces support increasingly complex business processes, the market participants begin to privilege the well connected small number to the convenience of the openness to the entire market. The participants see the marketplace as an exclusive club, the belonging to which provides a strategic advantage. The technology brought forth by the marketplace participates in shaping the strategic demands of the participants which in turn request the marketplace to redesign its own strategy. Profiting from this unintended demand, the e-marketplace assumes the paradoxical role of a strategic mediator: an agent who upholds and heightens the fences of the transactions instead of leveling them. The results have implication in shaping how we see the role of technology as strategic or commoditized.","2009-03-01","2022-10-05 16:18:32","2022-10-05 16:18:32","2022-10-05 16:18:32","55-66","","1","19","","Electron Markets","The strategic mediator","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Collaborative business process; E-marketplace; Electronic intermediation; L22; Technology strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I argue for a poetics of justice modelled on a practice of reading that incorporates both the kenotic and the aporetic. Contemporary literary theory provides a point of intersection for the disparate selection of texts analysed over the course of the essay: through the works of Jacques Derrida, I develop a notion of justice that requires an exegetical openness and interdisciplinarity that focuses on the textuality of mystics, philosophers, and novelists. The first two sections provide a broad overview of the theoretical foundations of the thesis: Derrida's analysis of justice as a fundamentally aporetic concept is used as a point of departure. Section Three offers an analysis of critical terms used in the course of my investigation. Section Four uses the work of Michel de Certeau, Maurice Blanchot, Dorothee Soelle, and S.T. Coleridge in order to investigate the unique linguistic characteristics of mysticism and their relationship to justice. Section Five outlines the ontological characteristics assumed in this investigation and draws primarily on the thought of Jean-Luc Marion. Section Six uses Elaine Scarry's work to analyse the relationship between aesthetics, mysticism, and justice. Section Seven investigates the works of three major figures of Neoplatonic and apophatic mysticism: Pseudo-Dionysius, the Cloud-author, and Meister Eckhart. Section Eight develops the theme of reading justice as evidenced in the work of Simone Weil and J.M.

It is based on examination of the transition from East German state socialism to West German welfare capitalism and how it changed work-family conflicts for typical East German families. It contributes to our knowledge of postsocialist transitions and develops a model of how work-family conflicts are embedded in broader contexts of social hierarchy. For this study, in-depth interviews covering changes in work and family were conducted with more than 80 East German parents four years after East and West Germany were unified. The unique situation of German unification revealed processes which remain part of the almost invisible background of everyday life in more ordinary times. As state socialism collapsed and the new, capitalist labor and consumer markets began to emerge, changed modes of social stratification resulted in new experiences of work and family activities. Men and women began to construct new meanings for work and family roles and the conflicts between them within the context of emerging social hierarchies based on occupational status and income. This dissertation goes beyond quantitative indicators of social change and reveals the human face of economic transition. It shows how changes in the workplace and marketplace after German unification resulted in pervasive experiences of increased social stratification, decreased social solidarity, and the overwhelming power of money. Because capitalist conditions simultaneously increased the desirability and the difficulty of succeeding at work, and posed family responsibilities as obstacles to success, these processes sharpened the conflict between work and family in everyday life and highlighted gender as a mechanism of stratification. Analysis of how particular couples responded to these changes as they grappled with practical problems of combining work and family vividly conveys the micro-level ramifications of economic transition. The specific findings illustrate the general point that contexts of social hierarchy are constitutive elements of work-family conflicts because processes of meaning and identity construction involved in work and family roles refer to social hierarchies which extend beyond the family and the workplace.","","2022-10-05 16:19:55","2022-10-05 16:19:55","2022-10-05 16:19:55","","382","","","","","Coping with capitalism","","","","","University of California, Berkeley","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780599713215","","","","","Social sciences; Gender; Germany; Capitalism; Conflicts; Coping; Women; Work-family","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analysis of data collected from surveys, one-on-one interviews, observations, and artifacts revealed that parents need effective and consistent communication, access to resources using technology, activities that provide parent choice, access to workshops designed to increase self-efficacy, and additional parental involvement opportunities and resources that focus on innovation. Lastly, to address these knowledge, motivational, and organizational needs, it will be necessary to design effective solutions that may disrupt the current culture of the school and may be unconventional.

Indeed, although extant literature has already discussed organizational analysis of illicit businesses from a marketing or an entrepreneurial point of view, few papers have focused on it. The purpose of this study is to explore and uncover the bureaucratic aspects of this kind of structure. To do so, this study intends to demonstrate that even the most hidden organizations in a given society are shaped by common representations orienting them toward well-disseminated models. Design/methodology/approach An ethno-sociological study was conducted, thanks to a long non-participant immersion (over one year) by observing a drug-dealing organization in a French suburban area located near Paris. Findings This study illustrates that illicit organizations reproduce traditional organizational schemes that help them to ensure efficiency and sustainability. Indeed, they fit into modern bureaucratic models within which procedures remain highly normative and formal, but also within which interactions between members are both constrained by a regulative framework and, at the same time, enable a certain amount of autonomy and creativity at work. Social implications The business case in this study analyzes the implications of seeing illicit businesses as organizations like any others. The counterintuitive results show that these organizations set and normalize processes allowing the establishment of a formal hierarchy, and specific yet strict rules. Originality/value The originality of this paper comes from its unit of analysis and specific subject.","2020-01-01","2022-10-05 16:23:04","2022-10-05 16:23:04","2022-10-05 16:23:04","145-163","","3","15","","","“Business is business”","","","","","","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited","","","","","Bureaucracy; Business ethics; Drug dealing; Illegal organization; Observation; Organizational behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It focuses on the Joseonjok (Korean Chinese), a group who live in Korea under a hierarchy of three different citizenship statuses: “the Special Status of Overseas Korean (jaeoedongpo)”, the “Foreign Korean Worker (dongponodongja)” status, and the “Foreign Worker (oeguginnodongja)” status. It examines the logic behind these statuses’ creation, development and the different socio-economic rights they grant. The paper shows how citizenship policies for immigrants (or foreign workers) have changed in line with the neoliberal transformation brought about by South Korea’s economic globalization: the original nationalistic basis of the country’s policies towards overseas ethnic Koreans has been adapted and subordinated to practical industrial and economic needs, and the hierarchy of citizenship statuses for Joseonjok is a concrete reflection of this complex economistic process.","2017","2022-10-05 16:23:21","2022-10-05 16:23:21","2022-10-05 16:23:21","557-589","","3","46","","","Hierarchical Citizenship in Perspective","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Institute for Social Development and Policy Research (ISDPR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mining sector has been chosen due to its unique position as a backbone of the South African economy, its historical significance and impact on social conditions, and its key role in shaping social policy. The paper considers policy complementarity as critical for social, economic and environmental development in order to achieve optimal redistributive outcomes, and develops an analytical framework for assessing policy complementarity through the dimensions of ""autonomy"", ""alignment"" and ""adjustment"". The paper assesses the policy complementarity of pre- and post-apartheid policy mandates; and the intersections between policy actors from the state, the mining industry, labour and civil society. This analysis finds that intersectoral policy connections are necessary, but not sufficient, for the achievement of optimal redistributive outcomes. While South Africa benefits from a robust intersectoral post-apartheid legislative and policy framework, and progress has been made in several areas, significant challenges remain as evidenced by the slow pace of legislative reform, institutionalized political corruption, low levels of trust between stakeholders, differing perspectives on the meaning of ""transformation"" and who is responsible for its attainment, and internal divisions in the labour sector. The paper concludes that three factors are of particular importance in promoting policy complementarity: the presence of multilateral platforms to accommodate dialogue and negotiation between stakeholders to develop the social pacts required for sustainable development; the retention of sectoral expertise within state structures to enable the effective intersectoral implementation of policy; and that policy be enshrined in legislation, protected and enforced by a strong court system.","2018","2022-10-05 16:26:09","2022-10-05 16:26:09","2022-10-05 16:26:09","","","","","","","","","","","","UNRISD Working Paper","","eng","http://www.econstor.eu/dspace/Nutzungsbedingungen","Working Paper","","","www.econstor.eu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The point of departure is the definition of a producer's status as the perceived quality of the producer's product in relation to that of its competitors. A ""loose linkage"" between status and actual quality is posited which derives, at least in part, from the nature, content, and extent of a producer's relations with others in the market. Because of this loose linkage, it is possible to distinguish between a producer and its status position in the market much the same way that a distinction can be drawn between an actor and that actor's position in an organizational context. The status position of a producer circumscribes its actions by providing a unique cost and revenue profile for producing a good of a given level of quality. Specifically, a higher status producer can offer a good of a given quality at a lower cost and potentially higher revenue than its lower status counterparts. The relatively advantageous cost and revenue profile insulates the higher status producer from a ""bidding war"" with lower status competitors and provides it with an incentive to reproduce its level of quality. At the same time, the higher status producer is prevented from invading low status niches by a constraint implicit in its identity. To increase its market share through the formation of additional exchange relations with other market actors is to change how it is perceived and, thus, potentially undercut the source of the initial advantage. This status-based model of market competition is tested in an examination of the competition among investment banks in the underwriting of corporate debt. This analysis yields significant evidence that the behavior, patterns of relations, and terms of trade are deeply embedded in the underlying status order of the market. Higher status banks use the cost advantages of status to effectively underbid their lower status counterparts to cultivate a pattern of exchange relations that ultimately reinforces their position in the status order. Alternative explanations for the pattern of exchange relations are examined and ruled out. Finally, possible extensions of the model are briefly discussed, with particular attention given to the relaxation of certain assumptions that may seem to weaken the model's broader applicability.","","2022-10-05 16:40:14","2022-10-05 16:40:14","2022-10-05 16:40:14","","176","","","","","","","","","","Harvard University","United States -- Massachusetts","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798641961439","","","","","Social sciences; investment banks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To a great, and somewhat stereotypical, extent popular representations of Indian–Australian relations are viewed through the lens of cricket – the national game in both countries. This study about a significant, yet overlooked, chapter in sporting history examines the Australian cricketers’ response to the social, racial and political hierarchies of late-colonial India. The experience of the touring party encouraged a re-imagining of ideological perspectives and this research has revealed a uniquely Australian subjectivity to the British colonization of India. The tour between the colony (India) and the dominion (Australia) can be interpreted as an anti-imperial gesture. Both countries were attempting to forge relationships that would be independent from Britain. The role of cricket, itself experiencing a renaissance during the 1930s as it transformed from a largely amateur pursuit to an increasingly professional occupation is interrogated. As part of this transformation international cricket positioned itself as an increasingly politicized global entity within the broader turbulence of the first-half of the twentieth century. All those involved in the tour are now dead. However a close historical analysis of previously lost, highly personalized, primary material (letters, manuscripts, photographs and cricket ephemera) enables an interpretation of the players’ experience. This study argues that sporting events can be interpreted as cultural ciphers yet scholars and the wider sports-writing community have neglected the historical significance of the 1935/36 tour. The unofficial status of the tour and its highly professional emphasis alienated it from the amateur ideals of contemporary Australian cricket. This transnational, multi-disciplinary approach addresses a lacunae in the professional trajectory of cricket. It also provides a new understanding and historical counter narrative of mid-twentieth century Indian–Australian sporting history and cultural exchange.","2019-01-02","2022-10-05 16:40:32","2022-10-05 16:40:32","2022-10-05 16:40:32","1-20","","1","22","","","An unsung history","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/21672857.2017.1329108","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal is to link the two in ways which offer insight into educational restructuring that is meaningful and empowering to students, teachers, and administrators. It views the current debate surrounding educational restructuring by using ""partnership"" as a unifying theme. The primary research questions I used as basis for this study are: (1) How can we educate our children and ourselves according to a partnership model for their future, our future, and the earth's future? (2) Can we take into consideration race, class, gender, and all other diversities so that the educational systems will enhance and empower these gifts for the welfare of human kind? I use qualitative methodology in interviews with fifteen educators from a variety of educational perspectives to examine the presence of partnership possibilities within these educational settings. I have asked each educator to describe his or her experience in metaphors and images. Compatible with the metaphors are seven movements which I describe as necessary to create a partnership educational model. Aspects of partnership emerging from these interviews are dynamic, in process, and capable of either growth or stagnation, depending on the decisions made by those involved in the partnership. I conclude the study with seven generalizations about creating partnerships in restructuring education. (1) Partnership, in restructuring education, is a complex, multifaceted process. (2) Leadership in partnership structure is very different from the leadership role in a dominator structure. (3) Alternative paradigms need to be sought out and explored for the possibilities of restructuring in a way that grows from the needs of that particular situation. (4) A partnership model demands the inclusion of all the stories in a community of learners. (5) A partnership educational model expands the possibilities of assessment and evaluative techniques. (6) Partnership offers a way to combine a social justice orientation with a vision of a new social organization. (7) We are at the beginning or even before the beginning of any kind of partnership restructuring of education.","","2022-10-05 16:40:49","2022-10-05 16:40:49","2022-10-05 16:40:49","","239","","","","","Pathways to partnership","","","","","The Union Institute","United States -- Ohio","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798209105718","","","","","diversity; leadership; Social sciences; Education; gender equity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A number of studies have investigated the impact of service recovery efforts (compensation, speed of response, etc.) on post-recovery satisfaction, mostly in Western countries. However, despite the importance of global markets, very few have examined how Eastern consumers react to service recovery efforts. Furthermore, none have examined the impact of cultural value orientation (cultural values measured at the individual level) in implementing effective service recovery programs. This is one of the few studies that have attempted to avoid the ecological fallacy, i.e., assume all consumers within a country are culturally homogeneous. Based on Justice Theory, this research conducted in Thailand, employed an experimental design to investigate how customer evaluations of service recovery efforts are influenced by interplay of the consumer s cultural value orientation and service recovery attributes (apology, compensation, cognitive control, recovery initiation, and formality). The results reveal that cultural values of power distance, uncertainty avoidance and collectivism do indeed interact with a firm s recovery tactics to influence perceptions of justice. In other words, the impact of a firm s tactics is culturally dependent, and consumer expectations and perceptions of service recovery efforts vary, depending on customers cultural value orientation. Finally, all three forms of justice (distributive, procedural, interactional) along with disconfirmation of expectations, positively impact on overall service recovery satisfaction. Unlike previous studies, we found evidence to indicate that there is a temporal sequence associated with the three justice dimensions i.e., interactional and procedural justice precede and thus impact perception of distributive (outcome) justice. The results have implication for marketing theory as well as managerial action.","2005","2022-10-05 16:55:40","2022-10-05 16:55:40","2022-10-05 16:55:40","","","","","","","","","","","","UNSW Sydney","","English","","Thesis","","","unsworks.unsw.edu.au","","DOI: 10.26190/unsworks/21938","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared to secular constructions of aid interactions, prayers provide space for Nicaraguans to position themselves as influential actors effecting change for themselves or their families. Through prayers, recipients portray themselves as influencing the actions of more powerful parties, including God and potential donors. They also pray for donors' well-being, thereby offering spiritual reciprocity for material gifts. However, the same prayers that empower individuals at the interpersonal level constrain their ability to envision transformation of social structures. These findings shape understandings of prayer as aligning actions, of the moral and social dimensions of receiving care from strangers, and of the complex and contradictory ways religious practices influence discourses of empowerment and development.","2016","2022-10-05 16:55:57","2022-10-05 16:55:57","2022-10-05 16:55:57","233-249","","2","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, Wiley]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four Realms of Leadership in the Essays of Adult Students","","978-952-15-3129-3","","","https://trepo.tuni.fi/handle/10024/114829","This study belongs to the field of leadership research and is focused on relational leadership. Relational leadership research is in its early stages and needs more attention. This study departs mainly from leadership research orientating in leader-centricity and its effectiveness. Relational leadership highlights the notion of leadership as a process, its ongoing nature and the importance of local-historical context. It also introduces the concept of “space between,” the moment where the leadership process is constructed in interaction.  This research emphasises the social construction and relational nature of leadership. The study is qualitative and inductive by nature, using narrative methodology in order to make sense, communicate, and construct the leadership phenomenon. The focus of this research is in reconstructing leadership using written essays of adult higher education students.  This study contributes in the field of relational leadership processes illustrating four reconstructions of leadership in the form of narratives. The four realities, coined here as realms of leadership, are: Excellence, Balance, Quasi, and Anarchy. They are reconstructions of leadership moments of different kind. This study also contrasts the realms by four core constructs: Professionalism, Behaviour, Development, and Expression. These invisible core constructs fulfil the relational interaction of leadership phenomena. Further, this study argues that the discourse of readjusting in the space between realms is an invisible thread linking the processes together. Leadership constructs in this study of four realms between which readjusting works as an invisible bridge. The contribution of this study belongs to the field of relational leadership exploring and constructing the space between in leadership.  By legitimating leadership as a relational process instead of describing it as an individual-based issue, this research and its idea of multiple realities invites the audience to dialogue and discussion.","2013","2022-10-05 16:56:29","2022-10-05 16:56:29","2022-10-05 16:56:29","","","","","","","","","","","","Tampere University of Technology","","en","This publication is copyrighted.

Latina/o parents who are recent immigrants to the U.S. are unfamiliar with the educational process in the U.S. and raise their children with different connotations regarding parental involvement and schooling. Concurrently, traditional interpretations of parental involvement are based on conventional dominant educational ideology that projects what knowledge is valued or not valued---significant or insignificant. This study refutes the notion that educational interpretations are neutral but rather born of deficit-learned paradigms and distorted epistemological constructs. Consequently, schools' stock definitions and characterization of parental involvement are in conflict with the subtexts of what parent involvement means from the Latina/o parent perspective and beliefs. This dissertation addresses the question of what knowledge is recognized, valued, and validated within the context of social inequality pertaining to equal educational opportunities of worth.","","2022-10-05 16:57:05","2022-10-05 16:57:05","2022-10-05 16:57:05","","289","","","","","Mexican immigrant parents and their involvement in urban schooling","","","","","Wayne State University","United States -- Michigan","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781109968330","","","","","Social sciences; Education; Immigrant; Latina/o critical theory; Mexican; Parent involvement; Schooling; Urban education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The contemporary discovery of the physiology and health implications of this phytochemical has renewed interest in using chocolate as a medicine. The medicinal use of chocolate has a long history, however. It was determined that chocolate was used medicinally in early North America. The overarching question was: when, why, who and what factors influenced its decline as a medicine, and given the rise of functional foods during contemporary times have consumers in North America resumed medical consumption of chocolate based on current scientific findings? There is a rich history of chocolate usage to combat some of North America's most horrific epidemics. Less clear, however, is why chocolate fell from ""favor"" as a medicine of choice. There is scientific support that suggests a positive relationship between polyphenols consumption natural in cocoa and positive heart health. It is still questionable whether these data are relevant for human disease outcomes where polyphenols are readily consumed at low concentrations and bioavailability is unclear. Researchers who have studied cocoa flavanols mechanistic pathways, mostly agreed that cocoa flavanoids show great promise as a vasodilator of the coronary arteries. The message that cocoa high in polyphenols may attenuate CVD had not been heard by the majority of our study participants. Bias against chocolate as a health promoting food—due to its high caloric content—needs to be addressed so that consumers can appreciate that chocolate can be part of a healthy dietary pattern. When it comes to the term ""functional foods"" most consumers surveyed believed that candy (chocolate) is ""not good for you."" Such findings place cocoa products in a unique position. Flavonoids, a functional nutrient natural to cocoa products, is advertised by some manufacturers as ""functional,"" yet convincing the public that chocolate, perceived as candy, can have medicinal properties may be problematic in the United States. Consumer stereotyping of this food product based on social constructs will limit acceptance of cocoa/chocolate as medicinal. Keywords.

The goal is to address conflict still present in governance across the United States. These problems are important because they impact the effectiveness of constituents in governing structures, ultimately resulting in a negative impact on the business operations of the institution as a whole. The purpose is to address conflict using a multi-theoretical framework by applying structural and human relational theory to socialize and train constituents. This single, common case, case study includes analysis of 16 participant interviews who completed the socialization and training process at the site. Site and participant selection occurred through non-probabilistic, criterion-based, purposeful sampling. Data analysis occurred through multiple rounds of sentence and paragraph concept coding in Nvivo 12 software. The first question looked at how WWCC socialized participants into a governance structure and provided training in a manner that facilitated diverse perspectives. Emerging themes include the structure of Governance Council and the sub-councils, and the pre-training and first session participants experienced. The second question examined currently housed processes and procedures that influenced participant collaboration and cohesion. Two themes emerged, the structure of the core theme groups and the second session participants attended. The last research question explored how the governance structure supported the cohesion of better decision-making information for the entire institution. The themes included the structure of channels of communication and the third, fourth, and fifth session participants experienced. Potential implications of this study include reducing conflict currently experienced in governance structure relating to structural and human relational issues. Future researchers could conduct a multiple-case or quantitative study to develop generalizable strategies for socializing and training participants or apply a third governance framework, political theory, to explore how power and influence impacts governing bodies once they are operational.","2019","2022-10-05 17:04:12","2022-10-05 17:04:12","2022-10-05 17:04:12","","243","","","","","","","","","","Northcentral University","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781392450543 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","","","","","Governance; Human relations theory; Organizational socialization; Participatory governance; Shared governance; Structural theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Five latinas with a minimum of two years of work experience in high technology corporations engaged in dialogues based upon a participatory research (PR) methodology. The PR dialogues gave rise to four generative themes: team membership, desire for recognition, perception as one of the few latinas in the work place, and co-constructing social worlds of diversity. Only one of the five latinas felt accepted as a member of a team. Four latinas talked of feeling excluded from team membership which negatively influenced their perceptions of work place diversity. The latinas conclude that diversity is occurring within the professional categories among female and male employees with the requisite technical degrees and work experience. A recommendation for future research is a need to challenge how ""managing diversity"" classes are taught by corporate training departments.","","2022-10-05 17:04:50","2022-10-05 17:04:50","2022-10-05 17:04:50","","183","","","","","Latinas' order of talk","","","","","San Jose State University","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780599305083","","","","","Social sciences; Communication and the arts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, the medical illness or disability of a child further impacts parenting and discipline styles as parents often need assistance. Although many parenting interventions exists, there are very few that focus on parents with medically ill or disabled children. Furthermore, the largest minority group in the United States is Latinos. Many Spanish-speaking parents struggle with parenting medically ill or disabled children, and there are also few parenting interventions that focus on them. Thus, there is a need to gather information and develop themes to better equip mental health clinicians in working more efficiently with Spanish-speaking families who have medically ill or disabled children. This dissertation includes a discussion of the literature on family, parenting, child development, parenting interventions, and the Latino culture. Also incorporated are the effects of child medical illness or disability on development, family, and parenting with a focus on Spanish-speaking Latino families. This dissertation also includes a summary of responses and themes derived from interviews with clinical professionals who specialize in providing support and/or therapy to families with medically ill and/or disabled children in Spanish and/or English at schools, hospitals, and/or clinical settings.","2020","2022-10-05 17:05:03","2022-10-05 17:05:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","Alliant International University","","","","phd","","","ACM Digital Library","","AAI28001057 ISBN-13: 9798662384347","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The work presents an analysis of the underlying themes that motivate such developments by drawing upon modern models of organisation together with contemporary perspectives on information systems. A network is seen as interlinked work processes supported by communication technologies; work processes which, in particular, can transcend space and time and enable team based approaches. The characteristics that might distinguish the network are set out in terms of technology, the nature of the work process, and approaches to traditional organisational functions. Associations of individuals, institutions and groups of people and institutions; and societal considerations affecting inter-governmental and regional developments are also considered. An analysis of these characteristics is presented within a layered model and further developed by the use of tools and techniques drawn from social network analysis. A detailed case study is presented using this theoretical approach. The case examined is the Commonwealth Network of Information Technology for Development (COMNET-IT). This is an initiative of the Commonwealth aimed at bringing together expertise and organisations from around the world to coordinate their efforts in utilising information technology in pursuit of development goals. The focus of COMNET-IT's activities is on adding value to the work of a group of geographically dispersed experts through the utilisation of electronic networks. The study provides a detailed theoretical analysis of the network phenomenon. Using structuration theory and social network analysis, this research provides insights into processes of network formation and evolution, network structure and the behaviour of network participants. The processes of appropriation of technology are observed and analyzed, and this work is supported by detailed empirical research investigating electronic group meetings.","1995","2022-10-05 17:05:14","2022-10-05 17:05:14","2022-10-05 17:05:14","","","","","","","Organisations and networks","","","","","London School of Economics and Political Science","","en","","phd","","","etheses.lse.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yritysten keskinäinen riippuvuus kasvaa samalla kuin ne pyrkivät keskittymään ydinliiketoimintaansa kumppaniensa avulla. Näin ollen vuorovaikutus on keskeinen prosessi, jonka avulla yritykset luovat ja toteuttavat tehokkaita yhteistyöjärjestelyjä. Tämä väitöskirja tarkastelee yritysten välistä vuorovaikutusta kolmen näkökulman kautta. Yritysten välisen oppimisen tarkastelu nostaa esiin kahdensuuntaisen vuorovaikutuksen merkityksen yritysten pyrkiessä rakentamaan suhdettaan tehokkaammaksi, innovatiivisemmaksi ja kaikin puolin toimivammaksi. Verkosto- ja suhdejohtamisen kannalta suostuttelu on tärkeä vuorovaikutuksen muoto, koska yritykset eivät ole toisiinsa nähden sellaisessa asemassa, jossa voisivat sanella miten toisen yrityksen tulisi toimia. Samanaikaiseen kilpailuun ja yhteistyöhön perustuvissa suhteissa korostuu kahden vastakkaisen vuorovaikutuksen merkitys liiketoimintasuhteen toimivuuden ja kehittymisen kannalta.     Väitöskirjan teoreettinen pohja rakentuu transaktiokustannusteorian ja sosiaalisen vaihdannan teorioiden päälle, minkä varaan rakennetaan teoreettinen viitekehys vuorovaikutuksesta. Tämä viitekehys sisältää elementtejä sekä yritystenvälisen vuorovaikutuksen tutkimuksesta, että käytäntöjen tutkimuksesta. Väitöskirjan empiirinen osio pohjautuu neljään eri aineistoon (määrällinen ja laadullinen aineisto), joiden avulla vuorovaikutusta tutkitaan kolmesta näkökulmasta monitasoisena ilmiönä.     Tutkimustulokset osoittavat vuorovaikutuksen tapahtuvan useilla eri tasoilla asiakas–toimittajasuhteissa ja että vuorovaikutus on hyvin eri tyyppistä eri teoreettisestä näkökulmista tarkasteltuna. Tutkimustulokset tuovat esiin mielenkiintoisen näkökulman siitä, kuinka käytännöt ja todellinen toiminta muokkaavat asiakas–toimittajasuhteita. Kaiken kaikkiaan väitöskirjan löydökset korostavat vuorovaikutuksen merkitystä ja tärkeyttä asiakas–toimittaja¬suhteiden luomisessa ja ylläpitämisessä, mutta myös osoittavat kuinka eri teoreettisten näkökulmien kautta sama ilmiö näyttäytyy erilaisena.","2018-01-30","2022-10-05 17:05:38","2022-10-05 17:05:38","2022-10-05 17:05:38","","","","","","","Exploring interorganizational interaction in customer–supplier relationships","","","","","Vaasan yliopisto","","eng","cc by-nc-nd 4.0","doctoralThesis","","","osuva.uwasa.fi","","Accepted: 2018-08-07T09:19:44Z ISBN: 9789524767941 ISSN: 2323-9123","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional Western norms about leadership are associated with masculine values such as power, dominance, violence, and authority that reinforce hierarchies and patriarchal structures. Feminist perspectives provide substantive alternatives to how we theorise and practice leadership in the new millennium. Beyond redefining the Rajarshi leadership ideal through a feminist lens, this chapter draws on other related Indo-Dharmic concepts such as the feminine divine principle of Shakti and the Bhakti movement that sought to break caste and gender hierarchies by emphasising on the vernacular and the unconventional. Thus, this chapter de-centres leadership discourses from patriarchal notions of entrepreneurial charismatic masculine leadership. It also simultaneously disrupts the idea that feminist leadership is a Western, modern, and colonial concept.","2019","2022-10-05 17:06:02","2022-10-05 17:06:02","","","","","","","","Feminism and Inclusive Leadership","","","","","Routledge India","","","","","","","","","Num Pages: 19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ten participants holding management roles or seeking leadership advancement in technological, health care, and self-owned businesses were interviewed to assess their perspectives regarding the roles of generation-Y future leaders. Five major themes emerged: (a) clashes between older generation and generation-Y leaders, (b) issues of entitlement, (c) factors related to personality versus those that are generational, (d) variations in decision-making styles, and (e) styles of collaboration at lower levels of organizational hierarchies. Other common themes that emerged from the study, and which are potential topics for future research, include (a) opportunities for generation-Y future leaders to adopt and embrace changes afforded by technological advancements, (b) the need for Generation-Y leaders to establish relationships based on face-to-face interactions, and (c) obstacles to work-place socialization caused by a rapidly evolving teleworking environment, which inhibits development of social interactions and bonds between team members. Results of the present study may prove useful to future generation-Y individuals aspiring to hold leadership roles involving management of a multiple-generation workforce. Organizations may find the outcomes of the study beneficial in their continuing efforts to cultivate and develop generation-Y leaders who will lead and be responsible for high levels of organizational performance and success.","2012","2022-10-05 17:06:26","2022-10-05 17:06:26","2022-10-05 17:06:26","","197","","","","","Generation-Y leadership","","","","","University of Phoenix","United States -- Arizona","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","D.M.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781267833204 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","","","","","Leadership; Social sciences; Socialization; Baby Boomer; Generation X; Generation Y; Virtual socialization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our critical analysis shows that by isolating individuals who were sick, fragile, and biologically and socially vulnerable, undifferentiated population management policies like social distancing, when piled on the structural weakness of health systems, reproduced inequities and risk for those in need of medical care, advocacy, and social companionship in acute moments of illness, death and grief.

In spite of the increasing business turbulence, over the years, and the challenges it poses for enterprises, few tools exist to assist managers in conceptualizing, analyzing and developing strategies for addressing this problem. To address this void we have, in this research, developed several tools for modeling and analysis of enterprise viability. Two tools, the Enterprise Viability Model (EVM) and Enterprise Viability Analysis Test-bed (EVAT) have been developed for viability analysis of firms under varying conditions of business turbulence. The EVM is an enterprise viability assessment and enhancement framework that is an extension of three modeling tools: Axiomatic Design, Viable System Model, and Agent Based Modeling. This research establishes the EVM framework as a basis for delineating the relationships between an enterprise's functions, its management and control systems, the turbulence in the environment, and the viability of the enterprise. The applicability of the EVM is illustrated by applying the tool for analysis of a case study involving a company's adaptation to the effects of turbulence in its business environment. The EVAT is a test-bed for conducting experiments to investigate the impact of enterprise's systemic attributes and the nature of its business environment on its viability. The EVAT is developed using agent based modeling and simulation technology. Applicability of the EVAT was evaluated by applying it to the viability analysis of an enterprise under three different management scenarios focused on product innovation, marketing promotion, and evaluation of viability tradeoffs between product innovation strategies and marketing promotion emphasis. The conclusion of our research is that significant, useful, and sometimes non-intuitive, insights into enterprise viability can be gained through the use of modeling and simulation tools.","","2022-10-05 17:07:45","2022-10-05 17:07:45","2022-10-05 17:07:45","","232","","","","","","","","","","Wayne State University","United States -- Michigan","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780549905929","","","","","Social sciences; Applied sciences; Agent-based simulation; Axiomatic design; Business sustainability; Business turbulence; Viable system model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, practical relevance of Operations Management (OM) research has been a persistent concern of academics in the field. This has produced an ongoing discussion of how the gap between theory and practice could be bridged, with methodological ramifications of proposed solutions causing tensions in the field. Design science (DS) has emerged as a promising solution to the relevance problem, and is currently establishing itself in the field of OM.  While DS has recently been acknowledged as a legitimate research strategy in OM, its novelty predicts an upcoming methodological debate. The aim of this dissertation is to propose a foundation for this debate, which would guide the methodological development of DS in OM in a direction that effectively bridges the relevance gap. The main thesis being that the methodological debate should be based on and built around design maturity.  This dissertation is a methodological compilation of four research papers, each of which reports an OM DS study, with designs of varying maturity. The studies use an array of methods ranging from simulation and quantitative analysis of operational data, to semi-structured interviews and participant observation. Based on the studies I propose a conceptualization of design maturity, and discuss knowledge creation and extraction at different stages of design maturity.  In addition to the main thesis that the forthcoming methodological debate in OM should be built around design maturity, I posit that for DS in OM: (1) differentiating and explicating the relationship (interfaces) between design and context is crucial. (2) Methods should be evaluated based on their ability to produce understanding of the context. (3) Designer self-reflection should be an integral part of research communication.  While the work compiled in this dissertation has had a real and practical impact on the studied contexts, general practical implications are indirect. These implications rest on the expectation that the results contribute to the emergence of a methodologically coherent stream of DS research in OM. Over time, this is expected to bridge the gap between practice and theory, securing the relevance and increasing the impact of future OM research.","2019","2022-10-05 17:08:30","2022-10-05 17:08:35","2022-10-05 17:08:30","","","","","","","Design science in operations management","","","","","Aalto University","","en","","","","","aaltodoc.aalto.fi","","Accepted: 2019-05-03T09:01:03Z ISSN: 1799-4942 (electronic)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"FQ5H2HXA","thesis","","Oifer, Eric Robert","Queering manhood: Exploring the weakening hold of heterosexual masculinity","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304641173/abstract/F25DBE1AC7014548PQ/1","Western political thought has marked the political realm as universal and masculine as opposed to the feminine particularity of the household. Due to recent changes in the social structure of gender, men recognize that their positions of universality are questionable and see themselves as harmed. Rather than simply relinquishing their power, men have sought to redefine the gender structure to maintain their privilege. In particular, men have softened masculinity by incorporating social codes of femininity that typically mark women's social existences. By incorporating femininity into masculinity, men assert manhood as a universal position to construct and critique social existence. This dissertation argues that instead of accepting these assertions of feminized men as universal, they should be seen as particular visions intended to maintain male power. The methodology of my dissertation relies on the idea that while modern manhood incorporates femininity into masculinity to maintain its universal position, manhood perceives men as distinct from femininity and women. In order to maintain this distinction, men must repress the feminine aspects of manhood. Because empowered manhood relies on repression, I use Freudian psychoanalytic theory as a tool to investigate this structure of power. In addition to providing a method for exploring repressed interests, psychoanalytic theory enables an investigation into why constructions of male universality rely on the incorporation of women and femininity, not just their rejection. Through a contextual analysis of various social constructions of gender, I expose how the incorporation of femininity contributes to male power and also threatens its sustenance. This dissertation explores social structures and cultural expressions for two reasons. One, they enable an investigation into how ideology is actually implemented. Studying the political theory canon is useful for establishing the bases for social structures. But, how notions expressed in the canon get manifested must also be analyzed. Two, politics is not solely rooted in public institutions. What has been established as political or public in the political theory canon only recognizes part of the picture. Politics is not just what excludes particularity, but how particularity and universality are established.","","2022-10-05 17:08:51","2022-10-05 17:08:51","2022-10-05 17:08:51","","342","","","","","Queering manhood","","","","","University of Southern California","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493288239","","","","","Social sciences; Masculinity; Feminism; Cultural politics; Heterosexual; Queering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2YHU2N39","thesis","2003","Okoth, Peter F.","A hierarchical method for soil erosion assessment and spatial risk modelling: a case study of Kiambu district in Kenya.","","","","","https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/81572","Though a lot has been done and achieved in erosion research and control in Kenya, most of the erosion research methods have in the past put emphasis more on quantifying soil loss or measuring soil erosion, rather than pinpointing to areas that are likely to suffer soil erosion. In most cases the erosion processes have been assumed to occur in a uniform manner at all levels of the landscape hierarchy, and hence the results of one level observation can be factored to cover other levels for which data was not collected. This has resulted in many people extrapolating site-specific point data to cover wider geographic regions, assuming uniformity of the erosion process over the region. Another interesting aspect of soil erosion is that though most attention is normally put on the negative effects of soil erosion, soil erosion has also some beneficial effects. For example, the deposition of eroded soil material to lower areas has sometimes improved the quality of the soil receiving the sediment, thereby improving agricultural productivity of the depositional areas. There have however been suggestions that the problem of soil erosion has been exaggerated and not proven to actually diminish crop yields against the background of improved crop productivity improvement techniques. All theses schisms makes it necessary to engage in soil erosion research, either to disprove the sceptics or to provide other means of assessing and viewing the problem of soil erosion. The general objective of the thesis was to develop and present a method, which can be used to assess the risk of water erosion for different levels of the landscape system hierarchy using spatial methods. The broad aim was to define relevant levels that form the basis for predicting and managing soil erosion and controlling its risk. The specific objectives were:     To conceptualize and define from the landscape continuum hierarchically ordered landscape elements whose internal characteristics and parts influence the occurrence of soil erosion and whose spatial extent and geometry enable their capture and modelling by remote sensing and GIS.     To prove that there are spatial features (erosion proxies) which are part-of, and internally contained in the hierarchically defined landscape elements that can aid in soil erosion risk assessment and modelling.     To demonstrate that the selected erosion proxies can be related to actual occurrences of soil erosion by statistical methods and similarly be differentiated as either drivers or disrupters of erosion.     To demonstrate that prediction models can be derived from field data collected on the erosion proxies and the developed models used for modelling of soil erosion risk spatially in a GIS for each of the defined levels.     To test and validate the method in Kiambu. To address these objectives, concepts associated with hierarchy theory, landscape system construction, geographic information systems theories, and soil erosion theories were knitted together to develop a conceptual framework and a practical methodological approach to effect and realise the objectives. Kiambu district was selected for testing the developed methodology due to its intensive utilisation for agriculture and its location in a rugged terrain in the upper footridges and footslopes of the Aberdare Mountains where below-canopy soil erosion is obscured by vegetation vigour and intensive cropping. Soil loss studies through river sediment yields in the district, indicate that there are high amounts of soil lost annually by water erosion. These range from 20 t km -2yr -1in undisturbed forests, to 3000 t km -2yr -1in cultivated to grazing lands. Soil loss studies from runoff plots in Kiambu indicate that cultivated land loses between 20 and 30 t ha -1season -1and bare soil loses more that 70 t ha -1season -1. Other justifications were prompted by the fact that soil conservation in Kenya has been focussed to the 'Catchment Approach' without necessarily defining what the catchment means. Perception of soil erosion by farmers was also biased to visible features of erosion such as gullies and tended to ignore the finer features of erosion like rills, interill erosion and other visible forms or erosion. Recent developments in geographic information systems (GIS) technology have made it possible to model and represent geographical real world phenomena in computerised spatial databases through which they can be stored, analysed, and displayed. GIS can enable stepwise and ordered analysis of the landscape system components as deemed by the landscape researcher. Soil erosion is a product of the interaction of many geographical factors such as: soil surface cover, the erodibility of the soil mantle, the steepness and length of the eroding slope, the erosive energy of falling rain-drops and the specific management aspect of the eroding site. It can therefore be assessed and modelled in a GIS environment as is demonstrated in this thesis. Concepts The method integrates concepts, knowledge and implementation procedures. First there is a priori knowledge that is collated in order to facilitate the study of soil erosion in the context of a landscape system. Knowledge and practice are invoked to organise the landscape system into hierarchical levels through which equally ordered erosion processes can be studied, assessed and measured. The conceptual model revolves around the construction of hierarchical levels in a landscape system and how the landscape holons and their parts relate to soil erosion in terms of assessment, prediction and management. Hierarchical construction of the landscape system allows an ordered organisation of the landscape components into superordinate or subordinate parts which correspond to process time-scales and their corresponding spatial extents. Such an arrangement of the landscape system allows relevant observations and measurements to be made of the ordered processes. The concept deviates from viewing the landscape as an agglomeration of parts in which processes occur presumably in a uniform manner, and where only size changes allowing for smoothing of measured results in a linear generalisation transformation. The method identifies 'individual' landscape elements in each level of the landscape hierarchy in which processes occur within comparable time scales and for which data interchange and modelling can take place. They are termed 'holons' . The holons are used to represent the levels in the hierarchy. Methodology The overall methodology comprised several parts involving first the definition of landscape hierarchies, followed by field observations, and then spatial data capture for erosion risk prediction. Statistical analysis and spatial modelling of erosion risk in a GIS followed the first three steps. The first step mainly concentrated on defining the landscape hierarchies that could be used for assessing soil erosion risk spatially in a GIS. Landscape elements were identified to represent each level in the landscape hierarchy. These included the field-plot, the watershed and the landscape unit. The field observation part involved the collection of soil erosion data in a stratified and randomised strategy where 164 samples were collected for the field-plot holon types, 89 for the watershed holon types, and 104 samples for the landscape holon types. Maps were prepared for each of the levels before field data collection and data points plotted on them for field reference. Collecting soil erosion data involved measuring depths of erosion features formed by either water or gravity as agents of erosion. The erosion features included soil movement, translocated surface litter, visible flow channels, depth of stem washing, depth of root exposure, rills, gullies, and mass soil movement. Only the encountered erosion features on each proxy were observed and measured. Where there was no erosion, zero values were recorded. For prediction modelling, independent spatial data sets were prepared for the three spatial landscape holon types and their internally contained erosion proxies. Aerial photographs were used to capture the field-plot and watershed holon types while satellite images were used to capture the landscape level holon types. This was done in the spatial data capture part of the methodology. Statistical analysis involved confirming that the selected spatial erosion proxies influenced the occurrence of soil erosion, first by the occurrence of erosion features in the proxies and secondly by differentiating the contribution of each proxy to the overall erosion using the analysis of variance and the mean occurrence. The spatial modelling part of the methodology involved the production of logistic and logit regression prediction models from the initial random data, which were used to manipulate the newly created spatial data sets to produce erosion risk domains based on pre-defined erosion indicators, herein defined as erosion proxies for each of the levels. Properties of the proxies such as their slope-gradient, percentage ground cover and soil erodibility were used as the predictor variables after being tested for suitability as prediction variables by correlation analysis. Results It was possible to use large-scale aerial photographs to capture field-plot and watershed level erosion proxies. Their real-world positions in the broader landscape were located using a global positioning system, commonly known as a GPS. The extracted holon types representing each level and their erosion proxies captured from the aerial photographs and satellite images were digitised and stored in a geographic information system. Field plots with their lands use kinds represented the lowest level of the hierarchy. Linear features in the watershed such as field-plot boundaries, footpaths, hedges, fences, tree lines, stonewalls, forest edges, wash-stops in tea and closed field boundaries represented the second level of the hierarchy. The highest level of the hierarchical construction, the landscape unit had river valleys, roads, and built-up centres representing the highest level erosion proxies. All the levels of the landscape hierarchy represented by different holon types, i.e. field-plots, watersheds, and the landscape units were stored as area objects while the erosion proxies inside them were stored as either area objects or as line objects. The field-plots were stored as area objects while the linear watershed proxies were stored as line objects. The landscape level erosion proxies that included built-up areas, river valleys, and road networks were stored as either linear objects or as area objects. From the descriptive statistics and analysis of variance it was possible to differentiate between the proxies that acted as the drivers of erosion as earlier postulated and those that acted as disrupters of erosion. The selected proxies for each of the levels and the frequency of their occurrences in each holon type supported the hierarchy theory of new and emergent erosion indicators for the different levels of the hierarchical organisation of the landscape system. Some proxies could be selected to act as the erosion indicators for each of the levels. Soil movement, rills, washed stems, exposed roots, flow channels and translocated surface litter occurred in all the field-plot level erosion proxies. Gullies emerged as new erosion features for the proxies of the watershed level while soil movement, rills, stem wash and root exposures occurred in one third of the watershed level erosion proxy types. Mass soil movement emerged as new erosion features for the landscape level proxies while rills dominated and occurred in all the proxies. Soil movement and gullies occurred in two-thirds of the landscape level erosion proxies. Important outputs from the prediction models were the odds ratios that provided quantitative values of how the erosion proxy properties influenced the risk of erosion. For the field-plot level holon types, a unit percent increase in slope created an increase in the risk of occurrence of soil erosion by 24% while a unit percentage increase in cover reduced the risk of occurrence by 8%. Slope added to the risk while cover reduced the risk. The risk contributed to by slope assumes constant cover and similarly the reduction in the occurrence of risk assumes constant slopes. For the watershed level holons, slope enhanced the risk of erosion by 36%. For the landscape level holons, a unit increase in percent slope enhanced the risk by 229%. A unit increase in cover percentage reduced the risk by 5% when the slope is constant. These figures obtained by the odds ratio show the erosion hazard conditioned by each of the proxy types. Slope and cover of the different multi-level erosion proxies proved to be important variables for predicting the hierarchical risk of erosion in the landscape system. The spatial data on predicted erosion risk provided useful information for erosion risk management. The spatial extent attribute made it possible to determine the amount of time and energy required for tackling the risk associated with any proxy. The object position helped in precisely targeting intervention measures, while the distribution showed the relative intensity of the risk in any given area and the proximity of the risk to known locations of the geographic feature space. The independently produced logistic and logit prediction models produced spatial patterns that corresponded very well with the predictor variables of slope and cover of the proxies. This obtained relationship gave credence to the predictive power of the models. The logistic regression models showed the probabilities of erosion risk in the proxies, while the logit models refined the risk zones due to the transformation of the probabilities to a longer linear stretch. The logit models therefore provided a broader spectrum of the predictions making it possible to distinguish areas with low risk from areas with very high risks of erosion that required immediate and prioritised attention. Strengths of the methodology and conceptual model The methodology seeks to establish a means by which soil erosion can be assessed and modelled at multiple levels in a landscape. It deviates from other single-level erosion assessment and risk prediction methods that are of common practice in Kenya and in many other parts of the world. It views the landscape as a medium in which water erosion processes are taking place in an intricate manner at different spatial hierarchies and which are also the entities for land use and erosion management. These spatial attributes offer the opportunity to predict and view the distribution of the risk of erosion on the broader landscape and at different attention levels. These create management opportunities are powerful tools for preventing or controlling soil erosion. The beneficiaries of the methodology outputs are seen as farmers, government departments, and other non-governmental organisations that are involved in soil and water management. Weaknesses of the conceptual model The following were the observed weaknesses during implementation:     In intensive annual farming systems, the features of erosion are usually obscured by frequent tillage practices making their assessment only possible immediately after tillage and after the event of an eroding rainfall or during minimum tillage periods;     The above reason means that temporal considerations must be embedded in the methodology where the observations in the field are timed to coincide with rainfall and field preparations; and     Any organisations opting to use the method must be fully equipped with GIS facilities and technical capacity to manipulate the spatial databases and modelling their attributes. Technical capacity is also required in the fields of soil erosion assessment and statistical analysis. Remote sensing knowledge and data offer the best opportunities for capturing landscape objects for integration into a GIS. Acquisition of the data and capacity to manipulate the images both digitally and manually are unavoidable requirements of the methodology. Overarching discussions and conclusions After collecting data on soil erosion and analysing it statistically, it has been shown that soil erosion in the field plot holon, watershed holon and landscape holon can be distinguished according to different erosion proxies for each of the holons. This finding can be used to refine the erosion prediction models such that the erosion processes are linked to the landscape holons with which they are closely associated. Scientific observations and measurements can also be ordered according to the holon type such that any extrapolations are directed to equal levels within the structure of the hierarchy. Different holons represent different levels of the landscape hierarchy. Due to the techniques of assessing soil erosion in the field as applied in this work, it was possible to show that soil erosion goes on even in tea plantations, coffee plantations and in forests. If erosion assessment is only based on farm fields, then the erosion in the in higher level holons such as watershed or the landscape unit will be masked somewhere during erosion impact evaluations. This thesis has also enhanced the recognition of soil erosion by using visible features to capture and measure incidences of past erosion. Soil movement, flow channels, translocated surface litter, are features of erosion, which are not usually discussed nor used for either assessing or quantifying soil erosion. Their use can now be integrated into further works. With the presented methodology of assessing soil erosion, more data will be generated and demonstrated to the farmers and other interested people on soil erosion and its hazard. The presented assessment and definitions in this work have also removed the problem of terminology especially in the definition of the landscape features for studying and managing soil erosion. The watershed has presented itself as the best management unit for many members of a community and can be adopted by any organisation concerned with collective management of soil erosion. The field plot remains the preserve of a single farmer while the landscape unit requires more of state interventions and deliberate management policy. Prediction modelling made it possible to assign a quantitative value to the risk of erosion. The landscape unit had the highest risk (229%), followed by the watershed (36%) and the field plot (24%). Resources and efforts must therefore be availed and directed towards addressing soil erosion risk occasioned by the landscape level erosion processes and proxies. Managing the landscape level alone will not have a net benefit if the two other levels are not also attended to since they equally suffer soil erosion risk. A holistic management approach will provide a more effective management approach to the soil erosion risk. Government priorities can be directed at the landscape level. Intermediate agencies such as Community Based Groups and organisations can tackle the watershed level risk while farmers and farming communities can tackle the field-plot and watershed levels. Researchable areas include in depth social studies that link biophysical spatial properties of the landscape to the socio-economic and policy instruments for each of the levels of the landscape hierarchy, i.e., field-plots, watershed units and the landscape units. Others are studies that link these landscape system holons with soil erosion proxies and soil erosion processes especially on their relationships with sediment yields, etc. to confirm further the notion of landscape hierarchies and erosion process resolutions. Finally, calibration and further testing of the prediction models in other parts of Kenya are recommended.","2003","2022-10-05 17:09:06","2022-10-05 17:09:06","2022-10-05 17:09:06","","","","","","","A hierarchical method for soil erosion assessment and spatial risk modelling","","","","","Wageningen University and Research Centre","","en","","Thesis","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","Accepted: 2017-06-16T09:03:42Z ISBN: 9789058087867","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Counterfactual verbal irony makes this point salient as the intended meaning is in opposition with the literal words. While past work has examined how contextual factors influence irony comprehension, less is known about how speaker and listener characteristics impact interpretation. Addressing a gap in the literature, this work examined how the social status of the speaker and individual characteristics of listeners (i.e., shyness, history of teasing experiences, perceived social dominance) impacted listeners’ interpretation of literal and ironic statements. An undergraduate sample of participants (N = 90) completed a series of “I Spy” games and were told that various players (described as either high or low in social dominance) were watching their performance. These (virtual) players provided the participants with feedback on their performance, delivered as either a literal/ironic compliment or criticism. Following each game, participants answered questions about the speaker’s belief (assessing comprehension) as well as their impressions of the speaker’s attitude, humour, popularity, and desirability as a future social partner. Within this first-person task, the pattern of comprehension was consistent with the existing literature (using third-person tasks) in that ironic statements were more difficult to comprehend than literal ones, especially ironic compliments. The speakers’ social dominance was not found to affect how participants interpreted literal or ironic statements. Listeners’ self-reported shyness, teasing experience, and perceived social dominance did not influence how speaker beliefs/attitudes were interpreted. However, these characteristics were associated with perceptions of speaker popularity, such that individuals who are shy, have a history of teasing, or low perceived dominance, tend to view speakers who use critical language as being more popular. Further, those individuals with a history of teasing or high perceived dominance perceived ironic language as more humorous. Although tentative, these findings contribute to a growing literature as to how listener characteristics influence how speakers’ intentions are perceived.","2019-08-22","2022-10-05 17:10:27","2022-10-05 17:10:27","2022-10-05 17:10:27","","","","","","","Interpreting statements from others","","","","","University of Waterloo","","en","","Master Thesis","","","uwspace.uwaterloo.ca","","Accepted: 2019-08-22T20:22:20Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, low-status individuals are frequently exposed to social stressors and unprovoked hostility in their daily lives. The current research examines how social status affects the processing of threatening faces. Nine studies, in which status was experimentally manipulated, test the hypothesis that low sense of perceived status leads to enhanced processing of social threat. Study 1 provided preliminary support for this hypothesis with low-status participants showing heightened accessibility for social-threat related words in a lexical-decision task. Building from that, Study 2 found that low-status participants were quicker at recognising target faces that were embedded in a social threat context. Study 3 utilised a modified Stroop paradigm to examine interference from irrelevant emotional face background during a categorization task. Study 4 investigated motivated processing effort in a facial expression identification task. Studies 5 and 6 used a dot-probe task to examine the time-course and selective attentional biases to angry and happy faces. Study 7 further examined the bias to perceive social threat cues using a change emotion detection task in which an angry face morphed into a neutral face in a short video clip. These studies consistently showed that low-status enhanced the readiness to deploy processing effort and focus attention toward facial expressions of anger. It also highlights the heightened awareness of direct social threat cues in low-status participants. Studies 8 and 9 investigated the ability to detect subtle cues of social threat in non-Duchenne smiles. High- and low-status participants did not differ in their explicit ability to discriminate between targets displaying Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiles, however, low-status participants showed a decrease in their preference to work the latter. The implications of these findings for the links between status, attention and social relations are discussed.","2014-03-28","2022-10-05 17:10:42","2022-10-05 17:10:42","2022-10-05 17:10:42","","289","","","","","The effects of status on the processing of social threat","","","","","UCL (University College London)","","eng","open","Doctoral","","","discovery.ucl.ac.uk","","Pages: ?-?

Seven studies demonstrate that political ideology systematically influences consumers’ preferences for differentiation. Conservative ideology leads consumers to differentiate from others vertically in the social hierarchy through products that signal that they are better than others, and liberal ideology leads consumers to differentiate from others horizontally in the social hierarchy through products that signal that they are unique from others. This happens because conservatism endorses, and liberalism opposes, the belief that the dominance-based hierarchical social structure is a legitimate mechanism to distinguish individual qualities. The effect is robust across measured and manipulated ideology, hypothetical and real product choices, and online searches in conservative and liberal US states. Manipulating consumers’ differentiation goals and perceptions of hierarchy legitimacy mitigates the effect.

How can hierarchical relations not be reconstituted among and between the different as they organize together?       <br><br>To answer these questions I want to look at three bodies of work which deal the most comprehensively with the assumptions underlying hierarchy and how we might organize non-hierarchically: the work of Helen Brown and her focus on the teaching, learning and sharing of all the skills of organizing in the construction of a flexible non-hierarchical  social order, based on the achievement of equality through sameness; the work of the French philosopher, linguist and psychoanalyst Luce Irigaray and her focus on the reconfiguration of the symbolic structures of Western thought through addressing  ‘the question of the age which must be thought’-- sexual difference-- and by extension difference and its relationship to sameness; and finally, the work of the Milan Women’s Bookstore Collective, who draw on Irigaray in their theorizing of affidamento or entrustment, a non-hierarchical  relationship between the woman who knows and the woman who wants.  It is a relationship which, by authorizing a place from which the female subject may speak, is the basis for the reconfiguration of the symbolic structure from hierarchy to contiguity, or for sexual difference next to sexual difference, difference next to difference, creating the conditions of possibility for contiguous organizing.     <br><br>How, then, are non-hierarchical organizing practices to be achieved?  Helen Brown’s work on the teaching, learning and sharing of all the skills of organizing in order to produce the flexible social order which underpins non-hierarchical organizing, as carefully done as it is, founders in two ways.  First, the teaching, learning and sharing of all the skills of organizing is indeed a first step towards non-hierarchical relations, but it is not enough because it fails to confront its central dilemma—it depends on the rhetoric of sameness to confer equality, so difference among and between women must be repressed, rather than understood as a source of creativity.  Secondly, it founders on the relationship between the one who teaches and the one who learns, between the woman who knows and the woman who wants.  How is this relationship between those who want to learn and those who already know different organizing skills to be structured, other than hierarchically?  How, in particular, are we to organize non-hierarchically among and between the different, without eventually succumbing to some form of hierarchical organizing?    <br><br>In her work on sexual difference, the French philosopher Luce Irigaray directly confronts this question of difference as necessarily always lesser than the Same if the construction of the Same is to retain its coherence.  In her analysis of our symbolic structures--our languages, the stories, myths, religions and philosophies we tell ourselves to make sense of our world--she maintains that we can rethink these symbolic structures to make a place for sexual difference—and  by extension, difference—as contiguous in relationship to each other rather than as hierarchical in relationship to the Same. This Same or the One is theoretically neutral, but is in effect masculine. It is the face of the man who sees himself reflected in the mirror of theory, and, mistaking himself as the sole representative of the human, erases his own sexual difference, and women, leaving no place for sexual difference, and difference, as other than a necessary, but erased, construct.  In our present symbolic structures, Irigaray argues, women hold the place of difference.  They are only objects; they lack a place from which to speak and name their actions as subjects.  Thus, as long as women are without a place in the symbolic structures from which to speak as subjects, as long as sexual difference and difference  have no place other than as lesser, hierarchy will inevitably reassert itself.     <br><br>The work of the Milan Women’s Bookstore Collective and their theorizing of affidamento or entrustment can provide us with some understanding of how we might go about rethinking the theoretical and practical exemplification of contiguous organizing practices. Entrustment provides us with a way of rethinking the relationship of the woman who knows to the woman who wants as other than hierarchical.   It is a relationship based on reciprocity and on honouring the authority of the woman who knows, authority meaning the place from which to speak in the symbolic structure as the female subject, the female subject next to, but not lesser than, the male subject.  It means that a place is created where one had not existed before, for sexual difference, and by extension, for difference,  to exist in a relationship of contiguity: for sexual difference next to sexual difference, difference next to difference.  To the MWBC, honouring the authority of the woman who knows in a reciprocal relationship with the woman who wants, means that in the act of organizing together, we at the same time reconfigure our symbolic structures, where the difference between the woman who wants and the woman who knows can exist in contiguous rather than in hierarchical relations.        <br><br>As Kate Young has stressed, the most effective organizing is the least hierarchical, and thus the most attentive to how difference can be reconfigured  as contiguous.  And in so doing, we reconfigure symbolic structures as contiguous: difference next to difference, sexual difference next to sexual difference, where the woman as subject finally speaks, and where hierarchy is no longer inevitable as we organize together.","2005","2022-10-05 17:13:26","2022-10-05 17:13:31","2022-10-05 17:13:26","","","","","","","(2005).

Nevertheless, issues of risk in the development of II have seldom been addressed. This dissertation addresses this important gap by drawing on recent contributions to sociological theories of risk to study the relationship between risk, culture and the occurrence of danger in the development of IT as corporate information infrastructure (CII). The thesis is established on findings from an ethnographic study of risk in the development of II with a multinational banking corporation. This thesis makes several key contributions to the field of IS, firstly to the understanding of risk in the development of II. Secondly, to theory development in IS risk research through the novel integration of sociological theories of risk into a theoretical model for the analysis of risk, culture, and danger in the development of ICT. A further contribution to IS research is achieved through the adoption of the impressionist autoethnographic approach, as a novel means of narrative construction within IS research.","2007","2022-10-05 17:13:40","2022-10-05 17:13:40","2022-10-05 17:13:40","","","","","","","","","","","","London School of Economics and Political Science","","en","","phd","","","etheses.lse.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The collaborations therefore also come across cultural diversities within the team. Though, this kind of team constellation brings challenges with it as well. The team members do not have the same opportunity to meet in real life and therefore virtual meetings become an important part in the everyday work. The purpose of the research is to clarify how cultural differences can affect virtual team communication during meetings. Therefore the aim of this research is to define challenges and success factors for virtual team meetings. A qualitative research design was chosen as the method for the research and includes a case study performed at an automotive industry company placed in Gothenburg which consist of two main national cultures, Sweden and China. A self-completion questionnaire, observation and semi-structured interviews were carried out with participants from different virtual teams at the case company. The empirical findings show that there are many challenges within a team consisting of two very different national cultures. Therefore the conclusion drawn from the research, shows that it is important to understand and accept the cultural differences. If an understanding for the other culture can be created, it will improve the collaboration between the team members. This will in turn improve the communication and also the meetings. However, the case company’s identified technical issues have to be solved first so the colleagues can communicate properly in order to manage the other challenges. A recommendation for the case company is to make sure that the Swedish and Chinese colleagues will have an opportunity to meet early in the project in order for them to create a relationship between each other. The relationship will create a better communication and by that more effective meetings.","2017","2022-10-05 17:13:54","2022-10-05 17:13:59","2022-10-05 17:13:54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","odr.chalmers.se","","Accepted: 2019-07-03T14:36:04Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I argue that the cultural pressures associated with the consolidation of consumer culture and the expansion of the white-collar labor market led to the development of a new narrative hybrid of melodrama and realism, a form I call the ""melodrama of everyday life."" Locating their dramatic conflicts in and around the intimate site of the nuclear family, these texts render visible for their audiences the impersonal and invisible social and economic forces contributing to the cultural anxieties of middle-class Americans. I examine bestselling novels by Booth Tarkington, Sinclair Lewis, and Dorothy Canfield in relation to the films of director Lois Weber, the Middletown sociological studies, and other forms of popular culture. I combine textual analysis with an active effort to theorize reception, tracing the ways in which key tropes were appropriated and disseminated widely in other forms of popular culture, and examining fan letters as evidence of the ways in which readers responded to and made use of these texts. I argue that these texts constructed ""structures of feeling"" that served more broadly as a way of perceiving and interpreting everyday life. These texts helped to reinforce profoundly normative stereotypes of ""typical Americans"" as white, middle-class nuclear families. At the same time, they provided powerful critiques of a standardizing mass culture, alienating white-collar work, and a competitive and dehumanizing ""personality market,"" and they strove to create alternative ideologies and ways of living that resisted or mitigated the most devastating of those pressures.","","2022-10-05 17:14:57","2022-10-05 17:14:57","2022-10-05 17:14:56","","382","","","","","Melodramas of everyday life","","","","","Duke University","United States -- North Carolina","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780599010871","","","","","Social sciences; Language; literature and linguistics; Everyday life; Melodramas; Middle class; Nineteen1; Popular fictions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a modern industrial society, safe containment and disposal has been the main strategy for managing waste, as waste is primarily understood as having a negative connotation. My research focuses on changing perceptions through enhanced understanding of waste, which can support its reuse. This work reframes waste as a potential resource with new labeling, and improves understanding about how waste transforms into a potential resource through technological development, as well as how eventually it can be an actual resource through behaviors of relevant actors. This research has made three contributions to the study of industrial ecology, environmental innovation, and industrial symbiosis. It establishes a new paradigm and systematic framework that is more compatible with the idea of industrial ecology. Under this paradigm, waste gets a new name and status as a potential resource with explicit values. In assigning values, this research recognizes the role of technology in determining the usefulness of materials. Focusing on the interplay between technology and materials, the research, for the first time, delineates the characteristics of such value-creating processes, or innovation for a waste reuse technology. It examines the influence of market, institutional, and regulatory drivers on innovation, and the lag between innovation and actual use. This research finally addresses the behaviors of actors governing the reuse of materials, in terms of technical, economic, regulatory, and behavioral variables. It particularly highlights the role of behavioral factors in handling challenges and uncertainties inherent in the reuse market. All the findings in this dissertation are empirically supported using the case of coal combustion by-products (CCBs). In 2009, the United States generated more than 120 million metric tons of CCBs, approximately 60% of which were discarded. One of the roadblocks for CCB reuse is negative perception of CCBs as toxic wastes, but 50% – 80% of CCBs were assessed as reusable in reasonably safe ways, according to reuse technologies commercially available in the same year. A more detailed study of CCB reuse technology identified and analyzed approximately 700 patents filed over more than 100 years. CCBs have evolved into highly resource-like materials through the development of these technologies, but their actual reuse requires additional conditions to be met, in technical, economic, regulatory, and/or behavioral spheres.","","2022-10-05 17:17:14","2022-10-05 17:17:14","2022-10-05 17:17:14","","237","","","","","Wastes as Resources","","","","","Yale University","United States -- Connecticut","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781267852946","","","","","Social sciences; Environmental innovation; Health and environmental sciences; Coal combustion by-products; Industrial waste reuse; Reuse potentials; Secondary materials; Wastes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Critical race work on “abstract liberalism” highlights non-racially inflected language that tacitly reinforces White socioeconomic outcomes resulting from an allegedly fair social system. Sociologists of religion have noted that White Evangelical Christian theology promotes an individualist mindset that places blame for racial inequalities on the perceived failings of Blacks. Using data from the National Asian American Survey 2016, we return to this question and ask whether beliefs about the importance of equal opportunity reveal similarities or differences between religious Asian American and Latino Christians and Black and White Christians. The results confirm that White Christians are generally the least supportive of American society providing equal opportunity for all. At the other end, Black Christians were the most supportive. However, with the inclusion of Asian American Christian groups, we note that second generation Asian American and Latino Evangelicals hew closer to the White Christian mean, while most other Asian and Latino Christian groups adhere more closely to the Black Christian mean. This study provides further support for the recent claims of religion’s complex relationship with other stratifying identities. It suggests that cultural assimilation among second generation non-Black Evangelical Christians heads more toward the colorblind racist attitudes of many White Christians, whereas potential for new coalitions of Latino and Black Christians could emerge, given their shared perceptions of the persistent inequality in their communities.","2020-07","2022-10-05 17:17:23","2022-10-05 17:17:23","2022-10-05 17:17:23","348","","7","11","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 7 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","","second-generation; complex religion; racial hierarchy; social attitudes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus the worker tends to aim for an adequate standard of living, security and personal satisfaction; the student looks for knowledge and preparation for the future; the sportsman for health and perhaps glory and prestige; and so on.

Human intervention has shaped and reshaped the GEA over the past century, affecting the ability of the landscape to provide ecosystem services. Ecological disaster in the 1980s precipitated transformative change in the management system toward an approach that adopts many of the recommended actions for complexity. Present-day management, which balances multiple social and ecological objectives, has led to improved water quality, restoration of wetland habitats, and a general increase in system complexity at the landscape scale. New research and real-time monitoring systems facilitate adaptive management and heterogeneous responses of wetland management entities. We argue that taking a complex systems approach to management in the GEA provides a common, and inclusive, conceptual model for all stakeholders and may lead to a more sustainable and ecologically resilient landscape over the long term.","2016","2022-10-05 18:04:22","2022-10-05 18:04:22","2022-10-05 18:04:22","e01363","","6","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.1363","","","","","sustainability; complex systems; ecosystem services; water quality; wetlands; ecosystem management; coupled human–environment systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It commences with a review of the academic literature, comprising of the studies and general approaches taken towards the subject matter of culture and family therapy within this field. The study thereafter offers a description of the epistemological framework from which the author is operating which can be seen as a combination of second-order cybernetics and social constructionism. This serves to familiarize readers with the frame of reference that has guided the approach to this study as it impacts significantly on the manner in which research is conducted. A detailed discussion of the research approach adopted in this study thus ensues. The research approach assumes a postmodern flavour and can be regarded as alternate paradigm research. The study also engages in an examination of the various discourses or schools of thought that have provided the predominant epistemological orientations within the field of family therapy. These are the systemic, first and second order cybernetics, constructivist, social constructionist and narrative approaches. The core characteristics of these discourses are critically described and their associated ramifications for culture are explored. Finally, the study attempts to articulate a South African Indian Muslim family narrative. In doing so, it draws on a number of combined resources. The primary source of data is in the form of personal narratives that are extracted from the author's own experiences and observations of being a member of this specific cultural group. This data is supplemented with community narratives regarding the family. These narratives are extrapolated through participant observation in a community setting. The main themes that emerge from both sources are then utilized as areas of discussion. At the same time, these narratives reflect specific cultural and religious discourses as the latter is threaded into the fabric of the former. The main areas of discussion involve family structure, cohesion, role allocation, communication, hierarchy and life cycle. Those academic narratives which are considered to be applicable and relevant are applied to the data where necessary, thereby highlighting features of significance and illuminating points of convergence and contrast. The author also attempts to explore the systems of meaning that may inform the patterns in the family.","2004-08-14","2022-10-05 18:04:32","2022-10-05 18:04:32","2022-10-05 18:04:32","","","","","","","The South African Indian Muslim family","","","","","University of Pretoria","","","© 2002, University of Pretoria.

However, more recent work on the New Testament which exploits research in cognitive science/psychology suggests that it can provide a helpful corrective and complement to anthropological and sociological approaches. In line with this work, the present essay will apply the psychological analysis of social dominance hierarchies to the theme of honor-shame in order to fill out the picture painted by the social-scientific approach and, in doing so, seek to highlight continuities between New Testament and modern cultures. It will conclude by suggesting a reason why it has been the case that scholars employing social-scientific criticism have shown less awareness of these continuities.","2019-02-01","2022-10-05 18:04:46","2022-10-05 18:04:46","2022-10-05 18:04:46","4-14","","1","49","","","The World of Honor and Shame in the New Testament","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patterson Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Professor Alys Weinbaum Department of English This dissertation treats novels by Anglophone Southeast Asians who see their ascribed multicultural identities (Malaysian, Filipino or Asian American) as conflating notions of race, sexuality, nationality and labor. Southeast Asian Anglophone narratives allow us to trace contemporary global multiculturalism as a strategy of governance that emerged from three historical conditions: British colonial pluralism in Malaysia and Singapore, American colonization in the Philippines, and regimes of liberal tolerance in the United States. Whereas these histories are rendered invisible or incoherent by U.S. nationalist narratives and literary canons, Southeast Asian Anglophone texts expose them as legible counter-narratives. This dissertation is inspired by the Malaysian literary theorist Lloyd Fernando, who, in 1975, envisioned migrant cultures as ""part of an unceasing process"" that are ""capable of continuing as if an infinite series"" (14). I dub this unceasing process ""transitive culture"" and trace its appearance as a theme in Southeast Asian Anglophone literature that sees migrants as self-consciously managing and reinterpreting multiculturalist identities. This dissertation builds on work by scholars such as E. San Juan, Jodi Melamed and Vijay Mishra who argue that the narrative of western multiculturalism often bolsters the U.S. as an exceptional power, giving legitimately to U.S. military and political interventions abroad. I engage with an overlooked archive of Anglophone writing to account for the multiple origins of multiculturalism that U.S. literature and discourses have helped obscure. While recent scholarship has used a framework of diaspora to disrupt nationalist formations, this has often marginalized the Anglophone cultures that imperial encounters have also helped produce. I adopt the label ""Anglophone"" to argue that texts from writers in Southeast Asia and in the diaspora allow us to see global multiculturalism as a governing strategy that conflates nation and ethnicity to mark national identities as befitting particular types of labor, and to cast ""multicultural"" nation-states like the U.S. as an exceptional force in global politics. By revealing the imperial strategies and historical emergence of global multiculturalism, Southeast Asian Anglophone texts disrupt the conflation of race, nation and ethnicity, and offer transition as a means of resisting rigid identity types.","2014-02-24","2022-10-05 18:05:03","2022-10-05 18:05:03","2022-10-05 18:05:03","","","","","","","Transitive Cultures","","","","","","","en_US","Copyright is held by the individual authors.","Thesis","","","digital.lib.washington.edu","","Accepted: 2014-02-24T18:22:26Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ESM requires active participation in order to be successful, but under contribution is a problem for many organizations. Some companies have invested substantial amounts of time and money to implement ESM platforms over the past few years with the aim of increasing employee engagement, encouraging knowledge sharing, and promoting collaboration. Research indicates that hierarchy and subculture affect the type of user participation in ESM, but a gap remains in understanding their impact on total user activity in other industries. This paper therefore seeks to close that gap by focusing on the impact of job level within the organizational hierarchy and by examining the effect of subcultures (derived from disparate functional backgrounds of users) on participation in ESM. This research is informed by organization theory (specifically bureaucracy theory) and contingency theory (specifically differentiation and integration) within organizations. The environment for the study is the ESM platform called the Hub at the U.S. member firm of IASL LLP, a large, independent public accounting firm. A non-experimental mixed-methods research approach using quantitative content analysis of qualitative data was conducted on the user activity of 31,774 provisioned users over an eight-month period between February 1, 2014, and September 30, 2014. Findings suggest that hierarchy and subculture have a significant impact (p<.01) on participation in ESM. This paper contributes to the organization development literature by expanding our knowledge of the impact of organization theory and contingency theory in ESM and providing opportunities for future research on how ESM can be leveraged during organization change initiatives.","","2022-10-05 18:05:32","2022-10-05 18:05:32","2022-10-05 18:05:32","","109","","","","","Opportunities for Organization Development","","","","","Benedictine University","United States -- Illinois","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781321832747","","","","","Social sciences; Hierarchy; Contingency theory; Communication and the arts; Bureaucracy; Enterprise social media; IASL LLP; Internal social media; Subculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It simultaneously argues that these scholarly developments hinged on a set of socio-economic conditions in Europe and the USA which defined ever-growing numbers of social forms in terms of the commodity. The great paradox, of course, is that the same historical moment in which the social was ?flattened? by human scientists also witnessed the emergence of new structural inequalities on an unprecedented scale.

Using qualitative interviews, we address this by focusing on adolescents from backgrounds particularly rich in cultural capital, namely students at Schola Osloensis, the most prestigious upper-secondary school in Norway. Our findings reveal that (i) these students value academic merit; although they embrace selected forms of pop culture, and are self-reflexively reluctant to describe themselves as ‘elite’, their lifestyle is characterized by preferences for classical cultural canons. They regard this as necessary to understand contemporary avant-garde culture and achieve academic success. They also exhibit (ii) a distinctive fashion style that does not only emphasize aesthetics but also involves moral-political aspects. ‘Hipster’ style is criticized for being too commercial, whereas a ‘nerdy’ position is embraced as compatible with a quest for knowledge and insight. They also adopt (iii) political positions on feminism, antiracism and environmental protection, seamlessly interweaving these forms of position-taking in their everyday lives. (iv) Those who break key moral-political and aesthetic norms are negatively sanctioned and there are few signs of truly ‘open’ and ‘omnivorous’ lifestyles. We conclude that an elite education in an egalitarian society such as Norway is associated with a purported non-elitist style, where liberal values such as gender equality and international solidarity are at the centre. Simultaneously, however, through their education at Schola Osloensis, these students acquire high levels of cultural capital, including symbolic mastery and an embodied ability to perform well in demanding social settings. These skills, we argue, will be useful at the top levels of a rapidly changing labour market. In pointing to the persistent salience of ‘old school’ displays of cultural capital, as well as clear instances of symbolic boundary work, our study challenges core assumptions in research about cultural stratification and omnivorousness.","2018-10-01","2022-10-05 18:05:46","2022-10-05 18:05:46","2022-10-05 18:05:46","54-66","","","70","","Poetics","Revenge of the nerds","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Status; Class; cultural capital; Distinction; Elites; Emerging; Omnivore; Symbolic boundaries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A mediating model was predicted such that gender differences in reward allocation decisions would be mediated by any one of seven variables: (a) I/C, (b) gender role perceptions, (c) perceptions of status differential, (d) SES, (e) need for affiliation, (f) need for autonomy, and (g) need for achievement. It was specifically predicted that individuals in the following groups will allocate rewards following the principles of equity rather than the principles of equality: (a) men, (b) those scoring high on individualist measures, (c) those scoring high on masculine gender role measures, (d) those scoring high on vertical I/C measures (as a recognition of awareness of status differential), (e) those with a high SES, (f) those scoring high on need for achievement measures, (g) those scoring low on need for affiliation measures, and (h) those scoring high on need for autonomy measures. Conversely, it was predicted that women are more likely to allocate rewards more equally. One hundred and seventy-eight male and female participants recruited from eight private sector organizations in the northeastern United States were administered (a) a demographic questionnaire, (b) two I/C measures, (c) the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI), (d) a vignette in which to respond with reward allocation decisions, (e) a need assessment questionnaire, and (f) an attitude questionnaire. Results did not support the mediating model. Gender was not found to be predictive of reward allocation decisions, therefore there was no relationship to mediate. Interestingly, the need for autonomy was found to significantly predict reward allocation decisions while no other explanatory variables were predictive of reward distribution. Additional analyses instead found support for a moderating model. An interaction between gender and collectivism was found indicating that collectively oriented males do not prefer equity allocations, while no effect was found for women.","","2022-10-05 18:06:01","2022-10-05 18:06:01","2022-10-05 18:06:01","","148","","","","","","","","","","California School of Professional Psychology - San Diego","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493190815","","","","","Psychology; Teams; Individual differences; Distributive justice; Reward allocation decisions; Task-interdependent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Coordination of processes should be performed in a decentralized way, that is initiated by the team members themselves and not by a higher authority. A methodology for adaptive team design based on Colored Petri nets is presented. It allows to define redundant responsibilities and coordination rules that are allocated to team members. The coordination rules specify for each team member what to do under what circumstances so that the overall activity of the team remains consistent.

Voluntary theories propose that human groups shift to hierarchy to limit scalar stress, i.e. the increase in cost of organization as a group grows. Yet, this hypothesis lacks a mechanistic model to investigate the organizational advantage of hierarchy and its role on its evolution. To fill this gap, we describe social organization by the distribution of individuals’ capacity to influence others. We then integrate this formalization into models of social dynamics and evolutionary dynamics. First, our results demonstrate that hierarchy strongly reduces scalar stress, and that this benefit can emerge solely because leaders and followers differ in their capacity to influence others. Second, the model demonstrates that this benefit can be sufficient to drive the evolution of leader and follower behaviours and ultimately, the transition from small egalitarian to large hierarchical groups.","2020-06-10","2022-10-05 18:07:35","2022-10-05 18:07:35","2022-10-05 18:07:35","20200693","","1928","287","","","From disorganized equality to efficient hierarchy","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Royal Society","","","","","evolution; hierarchy; leadership; consensus decision-making","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It establishes the theoretical relevance of modern hierarchical arrangements, distinguishing this modern interstate relationship from past forms of historical domination.  We orient hierarchy around the notion of mutually beneficial exchange, in which a subordinate state concedes authority over its effective sovereignty to a dominant state in return for the provision of economic and political order. Turning to the Middle East, we operationalize US hierarchical relations by unpacking the different provisions of order provided to local states, as well as the dimensions of effective sovereignty ceded in return.  We next organize and present an exhaustive list of indicators in an initial effort to measure the intensity of hierarchies witnessed in US-Middle East dyads.  We code the cases and discuss the early results, accentuating revealing patterns in the data. We find that Egypt, Jordan, Oman, and Bahrain present the most intense cases of American hierarchy, while four additional cases do not qualify as hierarchy — Iran, Syria, Libya, and the Palestinian Authority.

On the one hand, we witness an increase in mergers & acquisitions, which substitutes markets for hierarchies and, on the other hand, we see an increase in outsourcing and subcontracting activities, appearing to replace hierarchies by markets. However, there is evidence that an increasing part of outsourcing activities mix hierarchies with market forms of governance. The key argument of this paper is that firms have established governance structures based on markets, hierarchies and self-enforcing relational contracts so that they are able to keep a substantial amount of control despite of sourcing out labour. Furthermore, we argue that such hierarchical forms of outsourcing produce dependency. Using empirical evidence of the Austrian insurance industry, it is demonstrated that dependency is created, firstly, by the contractual restriction of alternative uses of resources, secondly, by support measures that bind the upstream party closely to the downstream party, thirdly, by relationship-specific investments made by the upstream party, and fourthly, by authority elements.","2005-09-01","2022-10-05 18:08:08","2022-10-05 18:08:08","2022-10-05 18:08:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","SSRN; Hierarchies; Relational Contracts and New Forms of Outsourcing; Ulrike Muehlberger","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","854865","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the growth in the virtual workplace accelerates, organisations face new challenges to cope  with new organisational structures and managerial leadership roles. Of particular relevance to  this study is that the new organisational forms necessitate new management structures, which  might be different from mechanistic structures. It also implies that the prevalence of managerial  leadership in different organisational structures might be different.  Using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) of Bass & Avolio (1994) and  Organisational Structure Questionnaire of Miller & Droge (1986), this research attempted to  investigate the prevalence of leadership in mechanistic, organic and virtual structures.  Hypotheses were tested to determine the relationship between leadership and structure;  leadership and environment; and environment and structure.  The data was collected through a field experiment. The study was aimed at middle, senior and  top level management. Of the 165 questionnaires sent out, 80 middle level managers, 20  senior level managers and two top level managers completed questionnaires.  The results reflect that both transformational and transactional leadership occur in organic  organisations. The results also reflect that both transformational and transactional leadership  occur in virtual organisations. The results of the survey also show that only some of the  organic-mechanistic dimensions predicted the prevalence of leadership in these structures. A  positive relationship was found between organic and virtual structures. Environment served as  a poor predictor for the prevalence of transformational and transactional leadership in a  dynamic or stable environment. The results also confirmed that virtual organisations do occur in  dynamic environments. However, no relationship was found between environment uncertainty  and either mechanistic or organic structure.  Conclusions are drawn from the results obtained and recommendations are made for future  research.","2001-12","2022-10-05 18:08:17","2022-10-05 18:08:17","2022-10-05 18:08:17","","","","","","","","","","","","Stellenbosch : Stellenbosch University","","en_ZA","Stellenbosch University","Thesis","","","scholar.sun.ac.za","","Accepted: 2012-08-27T11:34:51Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Implications for the forestry sector and the local community.","","","","","https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/1002","A large body of research has documented evidence of climate change impact already occurring on different systems on earth, future impacts can be expected.   Accordingly, research is urgently needed to analyze the potential impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems in order to contribute to better landscape planning and management.   This thesis investigates how climate change affects landscape change, and how to use this understanding in the analysis of land-use and landscape planning and management to adapt to climate change impacts.   In particular, this study examines how climate change may impact a managed forest in terms of timber availability, and the regional community that relies on it for its survival.  <br /><br />   I hypothesized that the Boreal forest in north western Ontario will change in the short term (i.  e.   60 years) in species composition and will produce less available timber as a result of human-induced climate change as modeled by different General Circulation Models plus harvesting, compared to a baseline climate.   The study objectives were (a) to evaluate the degree of change in land cover (species composition) under forest harvesting and various climate change scenarios; (b) to analyze timber availability under different climate change scenarios, and harvesting; (c) to describe possible scenarios of land cover change as a result of climate change impact and harvesting to assist in policy-making related to land-use and landscape planning; and (d) to identify possible sources of both land-use conflicts and synergies as a result of changes in landscape composition caused by climate change.  <br /><br />  The study area was the Dog-River Matawin forest in north western Ontario (? 8 x 104 ha).   It is currently under harvesting.   I used the Boreal Forest Landscape Dynamic Simulator (BFOLDS) fire model to simulate landscape change under different climate change scenarios (CCSRNIES A21, CGCM2 A22), which were then compared to simulations under a baseline climate scenario (1961-1990).   I also developed an algorithm for the geographic information systems Arc View©, that selected useful stands, and simulated harvesting and regeneration rules after logging, processes not currently included in BFOLDS.   The studied period covered 60 years to analyze impacts in the medium term in the landscape change.  <br /><br />  Results obtained were the following.   (1) There will be a shortage in timber availability under all scenarios including the baseline.   The impacts of climate change will cause a deficit in timber availability much earlier under a warmer scenario with respect to the baseline.   The combined impact of climate change and harvesting could diminish timber availability up to 35% compared to the baseline by year 2040 under the CCSRNIES A21 scenario mainly due to an increase in fires.   Deficits will occur 10 years before in the same scenario compared to the baseline (by year 2035).   (2) In both scenarios and the baseline, there will be a younger forest.   In 60 years, there will not be mature forest to support ecological, social and economic processes, as the forest will only have young stands.   (3) Results obtained indicated that species composition will not change importantly among the scenarios of climate change and the baseline every decade, but there will be a change in dominance along the 60 years of the simulation under each scenario including the baseline.   Softwood increased in dominance and hardwood decreased in all scenarios.  <br /><br />  The period length used in the simulation of 60 years appeared to be too short to reveal conspicuous changes in species composition.   Increases observed in softwood over hardwood related to the increase in fires which promoted the establishment of species such as jack pine as well as the application of regeneration rules after logging.   This finding did not agree with the hypothesis.   Results of timber availability were consistent with what I expected.   Warmest climate change scenarios (CCSRNIES A21) impacted both the amount of timber available (less availability every ten years) from the beginning of the simulation and the time when deficits occurred.    <br /><br />   There are important economic, social and environmental implications of the results of this study, namely a future forest that would be young and would supply much less timber.    For the forestry industry, production goals would be hindered in the medium term, falling short of industry demands.   For a society that depends heavily upon the forest to survive, declining production can imply unemployment, thus affecting the welfare of the community.   For the environment, such a young, fragmented forest could be unable to sustain important key species and ecological processes, leading to a loss of biodiversity, Land-use and landscape planning should be used to regulate how the land is used to minimize climate change impact.   They should be further used as adaptation tools, to help in ameliorate those climate change impacts that do occur.","2005","2022-10-05 18:08:59","2022-10-05 18:08:59","2022-10-05 18:09:00","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Waterloo","","en","Copyright: 2005,    Muñoz-Márquez Trujillo , Rafael Arturo.

Adopting a Money View perspective, it argues that the IMS, in contrast to wide-spread skepticism, does have a system-like quality. This paper understands the IMS as a US-centered hierarchical payments system within which short-term debt instruments are issued as credit money by various public and private financial institutions, in particular central, commercial and shadow banks. With the Fed located at the apex of the IMS, credit money forms denominated in US dollars are located highest up in the hierarchy and trade at par with each other, whilst they typically have fluctuating exchange rates to credit money forms denominated in the units of account of other monetary jurisdictions. From this, the paper argues that the key component of today’s IMS is the 'realm' of offshore US dollar creation, which is situated in between US dollar-denominated credit money issued in the US ('onshore dollars') and non-US dollar-denominated credit money issued outside the US. In this 'offshore dollar realm', non-US financial institutions are able to create international liquidity via US dollar-denominated private credit money outside the US. The paper systematically carves out the post-2008 setup of the offshore dollar realm with a focus on Eurodollar deposits, offshore money market fund shares, foreign exchange swaps and central bank swaps. With the institutional innovations materializing during the 2007-9 Financial Crisis, the IMS is now a public- private hybrid that fully mirrors the onshore US monetary system in the offshore dollar realm.","2018-06-06","2022-10-05 18:09:06","2022-10-05 18:09:06","2022-10-05 18:09:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","Transformation; 2007-9 Financial Crisis; Central Bank Swap Lines; Credit Money; Eurodollars; Federal Reserve; Foreign Exchange Swaps; Functionalism; International Monetary System; Money View; Offshore; Shadow Banking; Shadow Money","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3191981","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of these intellectuals saw a family as a system, a cadet of ideas. Another one saw families as collections of individuals struggling to balance feelings, irrationalities and desires. (Nichols M.P. I Schwartz, R.C. 1995 :ix). From the mid 1970's onwards family therapy as a intervention strategy in social work succeeded and expanded, it was extended to encompass client populations from different cultural backgrounds, and special groups e.g. drug additions. These context suggest that family therapy needs to he practiced within the context of a particular culture. The purpose of this study is to explore the Xhosa families perceptions on family therapy and the role of culture in their life style. Family therapy will be used as a model because it will assist the researcher to establish and present the methods for implementation of family therapy in social work a id in Xhosa families. The study was conducted among social workers of Welfare agencies and Xhosa families. Two social workers were selected and they fully participated. These social workers are employed by the Department of Welfare in the Lowveld and Eastern Region of Eastern Cape, with three years or more experience. Non-probability purposive sample was used to select the respondents. A qualitative methodology was used to understand the life events, experiences and beliefs of family members, from their viewpoint. Semi-structure interviews was used to gather data for the research. The research findings reveals that cultural consideration is important when working with Xhosa families because they have their own perceptions of family therapy. Alternate abstract: Gesinsterapie het ontstaan in die laat 1950's. Dit was ontwikkel deur 'n heterogeniese groep navorsers wat in onderskeie kontekse en met verskillende doelstellings gewerk het. Een van hierdie intcllekte het 'n familic gesien as 'n sisteem; 'n dracr van idces. 'n Ander het families gesien as 'n versameling individue wat sukkel om gevoelens, irrasionaliteite en bchoeftes te balanseer. (Nichols M.P. en Schwartz, R.C. 1995: ix). Sedert die middel 1970's het gesinsterapie as 'n interwenste strategic in maatskaplike werk geslaag en uitgebrei om kliente van verskillende kulturcle agtergronde, sowel as groepe met dwelmverslawings, in te sluit. Hierdie konteks stel voor dat gesinsterapie in die konteks van 'n spesifieke kultuur beocien behoort te word. Die doel van hierdie studie is om die Xhosa families se perscpsies van gesinsterapie te ondersock, en die rol wat kultuur speel in hul leefwysc. Gesinsterapie sal as 'n model gebniik word aangesien dit die navorser sal help om die metodes vir die implementering van gesinsterapie in maatskaplike werk en in Xhosa families bekend te stel. Die studie was onderneem tussen maatskaplike werkers van maatskaplike agentskappe en Xhosa families. Twee maatskaplike werkers was gekies en hulk voile deelname verleen. Hulk is werksaam by die Departement van Welsyn in die Laeveld en die Oosterse deel van die Oos Kaap, en het drie jaar of meer ondervinding. 'n Nie-waarskyr likheids, doelbewuste metode was gebruik om die respondente te selekteer. 'n Kwalitatiewe metode was gebuik om die lewensgebeurc, ondervindinge en gelowe vanuit familielede se oogpunt te verstaan. Semi-gestruktureerde onderhoude was gebruik om data vir die navorsing te versamel. Die navorsingsbcvindinge toon dat kulturcle oorwegings helangrik is wanneer met Xhosa families gewerk word omdat hulle hul eie idees het van gesinsterapie.","","2022-10-05 18:09:44","2022-10-05 18:09:44","2022-10-05 18:09:44","","98","","","","","","","","","","University of Johannesburg (South Africa)","South Africa","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798738689529","","","","","Communication; Culture; Social psychology; Qualitative research; System theory; Stereotypes; Influence; Data analysis; Values; African literature; Children & youth; Data collection; Individual & family studies; Literature; Marital status; Marriage; Mediators; Murders & murder attempts; Norms; Perceptions; Personal relationships; Research methodology; Roles; Siblings; Social work; Social workers; Society; Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To that end the study aims to understand leadership  styles in an automotive company and workplace leadership differences between  Sweden and foreign employee‟s countries of origin.  Theory: The theoretical framework is based on three understandings. First Alvesson &  Spicer‟s (2011) metaphors for leadership together with the leadership triangle  (leaders, followers and context). Secondly, the two leadership styles  transformational and transactional leadership, which are used to interpret how  the respective managers lead their teams. Thirdly, in relation to the leadership  differences that could exist between Sweden and countries of origin for foreign  employees, some of Hofstede‟s cultural dimensions are used to review how  culture contributes to the identified differences.  Method: A qualitative study based on in-depth open-ended interviews that took a  narrative and interpretative approach was conducted. The study involved 15  interviews in total at an automotive company. 13 with foreign employees who  are engineers and 2 interviews were conducted with 2 HR informants to  understand the leadership strategy and support available for managers to fulfil  their leadership duties. The sample included interview participants with 3-15  years of automotive experience who have worked and lived in Sweden for at  least 3 years. In addition the participants had worked in automotive industries in  their home countries.  Results: In meeting the purpose, this study revealed that transformational leadership is  more used in the automotive company than transactional leadership.  Respondents‟ descriptions of their respective managers fit with three metaphors  according to Alvesson & Spicer‟s typology (the Saint, the Buddy and the  Gardener). The study further revealed the existence of leadership differences  between respondents‟ countries of origin and Sweden in aspects like hierarchy,  female managers, knowledgeable managers and distributed leadership being  used.","2020-09-09","2022-10-05 18:10:11","2022-10-05 18:10:14","2022-10-05 18:10:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","gupea.ub.gu.se","","Accepted: 2020-09-09T08:31:17Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social capital construction is seen as one of the critical success factors to these executives. This exploratory case study was to examine what factors impact organizational leaders' social capital building. This study also sought to examine the effects of participating in an annual leadership development seminar toward the creation of social capital in global contexts. The factors identified in this study were: perceived interactive opportunities, individual-owned resources, and motivational interactivity constraints. The research site for this study was a global professional services firm. The sample was a total of 520 organizational leaders from 51 countries that were promoted within the last 5 years. Online surveys were the main tools for this study. As a supplement, qualitative data obtained from 15 telephone interviews, field observation, and archival documents were collected. The major findings of this study highlight the effects of the identified three components: interactive opportunities, individual-owned resources, and motivational interactivity constraints toward leaders' social capital (advice ties and network relations). Cultural orientation factors (embeddedness, hierarchy, and mastery) impacting leaders' social capital formation reveal interesting results among this diverse research population. Further, drawn from the interview data, leaders' motivation toward constructing social capital is discussed. The leadership development seminar's impact on leaders' social capital is discussed as well. Given the results, this study presents an organizational leaders' social capital growth model. The model indicates how the identified three components can expand advice ties and network relations as organizational leaders' social capital. Theoretical and practical implications and future research are discussed.","","2022-10-05 18:10:30","2022-10-05 18:10:30","2022-10-05 18:10:30","","145","","","","","Global organizational leaders' social capital formation","","","","","Teachers College, Columbia University","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781124255439","","","","","Social sciences; Education; Social capital; Organizational leaders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address the distribution of these biases we show how two types of emergent roles in hierarchically organized production chains affect noncompetitive price diffusion both horizontally and vertically in the industrial hierarchy. More concretely our model addresses such questions as how it is that, as in the case of this specific industrial hierarchy, processing activities and parts and components manufacturing organized by the “elite” buyers for the top manufacturers, while executed by numerous smaller enterprises lower in Ohta hierarchy, leave so many low-level suppliers subject to monopsony. Monopsony and monopoly (and to a lesser extent, duopoly and duopsony) are structures that may severely reduce profit margins. We use two complementary frameworks to pose and address such questions. One is network economics where monopsony and duopsony and their potential effects on pricing are well defined, like those of monopoly and duopoly. The other is network sociology, where we can define more fundamental concepts of the network construction of social and economic processes and institutions and the effects of network structure in transactional situations. We regard both frameworks as necessary to modeling elements of global and regional economies.","2007-10-25","2022-10-05 18:10:49","2022-10-05 18:10:49","2022-10-05 18:10:49","","","3","2","","","Network Structures in Industrial Pricing","","","","","","","en","","","","","escholarship.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this qualitative study, we characterized the way clients and therapists described the quality of working alliance during the mental health intake and examined whether these descriptions vary as a function of their social identities. We conducted in-depth interviews with Ashkenazi (socially advantaged group; n?=?22) therapists and their Mizrahi (socially disadvantaged group n?=?29) or Ashkenazi (n?=?26) clients immediately following their intake session in four mental health clinics in Israel. We performed a thematic analysis. Overall, interrater reliability among three raters who coded the narratives was high (kappa?=?0.72, therapist; 0.70, client). Across all client and therapist interviews, we identified eight central themes detailing different qualities of the working alliance: (1) feeling understood, (2) feeling comfortable, (3) openness and cooperation, (4) trust, (5) empathy and identification, (6) frustration and disappointment, (7) anger and hostility, and (8) emotional disengagement. On average, clients reported 2.56 (standard deviation?=?1.17) and therapists described 2.65 (standard deviation?=?1.45) themes in each session. Overall, concordant and discordant dyads described similar themes with few exceptions. In particular, being part of a discordant dyad may affect the client?s interpretation of non-verbal communication as well as the therapist?s evaluation of the client?s openness and trustworthiness. Although less frequent, when anger and hostility were described by therapists, these characterized the interaction with Mizrahi clients. We discuss implications to care including the need to promote a culturally humble approach to providing care for minorities.","2021-07-01","2022-10-05 18:11:00","2022-10-05 18:11:00","2022-10-05 18:11:00","1006-1024","","4","20","","Qualitative Social Work","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Women have been underrepresented because of the perceptions masculinism and gender hierarchy have created. These ideologies privilege men and masculine qualities, which puts women at a disadvantage. Research has shown that women are just as successful as men when running for office. Women, however, remain underrepresented primarily because they choose not to run. A few reasons why women choose not to run are that their roles as wives and mothers may interfere with their candidacies and they tend to have less money, fewer political contacts, and less appropriate employment histories. Aside from women choosing not to run, there are some other reasons why women are underrepresented in United States politics and these are referred to as barriers that need to be overcome. Some of these barriers are social and gendered stereotypes, incumbency, sex discrimination and the political system itself. These barriers pose a problem because they deter women from running for office and they keep the women who run from succeeding. Women have successfully weakened many of these barriers but there is still progress to be made in order for them to reach parity.","2012","2022-10-05 18:11:52","2022-10-05 18:11:55","2022-10-05 18:11:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/","","","","repository.arizona.edu","","Accepted: 2013-03-08T22:05:42Z Publisher: The University of Arizona.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It reveals that national and sub-national governments in Portugal are collectively pursuing an unsustainable transportation finance policy that places a significant burden on the public finance system, unfairly privileges the nation's metropolitan areas, and enables a costly and highly politicized tug-of-war between central government and sub-national governments with respect to public transportation investments.","2008","2022-10-05 18:12:49","2022-10-05 18:12:49","2022-10-05 18:12:49","","","","","","","Stuck with the bill, but why?","","","","","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","","eng","M.I.T. theses are protected by  copyright.

Furthermore, this study explored how often school administrators reviewed retention literature and whether the literature influenced their overall opinion of retention. Lastly, this research examined interventions strategies that are most effective for kindergarten through third grade students with academic difficulty. Retention literature was reviewed that included: a definition of retention, the demographics of retained students, research opposing retention, early withdrawal from school, research supporting retention, alternatives to retention, and perspectives of retention. This study was designed with a mixed-method approach and involved 25 participants from a school district in New Jersey. The results from the School Administrators Kindergarten through Third Grade Retention Beliefs Questionnaire were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. The findings from both forms of data revealed administrators did not generally favor retention. Administrators did indicate times when retention was acceptable particularly when a child's grade, age, and level of maturity were considered. Differences in administrators' retention perspectives were also discovered amongst various subgroups. The results also suggested that administrators did not read retention literature on regular basis, nor were their views influenced by retention literature. Additionally, administrative experience appeared to impact the amount retention literature read, as well as the level of influence literature had on administrators' retention perspectives. The Teacher Efficacy theme was found as the most effective alternative to retention when students have academic difficulty.

Elements for the Comparative Analysis of the Constitution of Self-Organised Groups","","","","","https://opus.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/25149","The notions self-organisation and self-regulation are at least implicitly loaded with a positive democratic connotation. The main corresponding debates on social movements, governance and civil society mostly refer to the Global North with a well-functioning state and democratic political systems. One consequence is that the less democratic and less liberal hidden side of self-organisation, seen by some critics, does not gain much attention. After a short discussion of the main theoretical approaches, the paper presents a selection of self-organised groups depicting their different values, norms, and structural features. These examples reach from democratic groups marked by solidarity to racist violent groups that are a threat to differently minded people. The analysis of these examples leads to a set of criteria for the comparative analysis of the internal structure of self-organised groups including potential membership, in- and outward orientation, underlying basic principles of social order and types of trust with related types of decision-making. These basic elements help to understand the constitution and functioning of self-organisation, which are open to a wide range of value orientation.","2021","2022-10-05 18:14:42","2022-10-05 18:15:04","2022-10-05 18:14:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.de","","","","opus.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This dissertation tells the stories of three Michigan schools—two charter schools, and one traditional public school. Each school in this study presented different challenges and issues, and as a result, their accountability stories were quite different from one another. Together the cases reveal three possible accountability environments—compounding, congruent, competing. Compounding accountability environments are characterized by multiple agents, operating with similar expectations and employing different means of achieving the same ends. Congruent accountability environments feature multiple agents working towards a similar goal, implementing comparable accountability frameworks. In compounding accountability environments multiple agents operate in an effort to support different educational visions and attempt to implement contradictory accountability frameworks. The three cases of accountability described in this dissertation illuminate the complexity of public schools and public school reforms. The process of accountability at these schools appeared to be a function of multiple authorities and accountability systems operating simultaneously. Furthermore, these cases show that accountability systems within schools operate based upon the relationships between authorities, the attention paid to cultivating shared values, as well as the emphasis on regulation to enforce ideology. This dissertation revealed that accountability is more than authority and mechanisms. In the schools participating in this study, accountability involved the relationships among authorities and the mechanisms that each authority endorsed. For the educators in this study, accountability was more than being subject to regulation; it involved a set of beliefs, processes, and relationships. Ultimately, this dissertation concludes that ideology, regulation, and human agency all contribute to what we commonly call accountability.","","2022-10-05 18:15:32","2022-10-05 18:15:32","2022-10-05 18:15:32","","253","","","","","Accountability is more than markets, missions, or mechanisms","","","","","Michigan State University","United States -- Michigan","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780599771994","","","","","Education; Accountability; Public schools; Charter schools; Michigan; Reform","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Attention should be paid to depression for several reasons, including the risk of suicide. The presentation of depressed males differs from that of depressed females. They may display additional symptoms not typically associated with depression, such as anger, hostility, withdrawal and substance abuse, and may not show sadness or tearfulness. Men's reluctance to seek help, and the strong association between shame and depression, make detection even more difficult. Research suggested that families in which fathers display negativistic parenting practices, such as hostility and low levels of warmth, suffer undesirable outcomes. Conflict resolution strategies may be impaired in depressed men, and there is research available showing that depression is correlated with marital discord. Men with depression may also be at risk for substance abuse disorders, intimate partner violence, and child maltreatment.

Ethnocultural identification was measured using the Japanese Multi-Index Ethnocultural Identification Scale (JMIEIS), a multi-dimensional approach to measuring ethnocultural identity. Verbal attitudes were measured using the Measurement of Attitudes Toward Verbal Behavior. The JMIEIS and the MATVB were administered primarily to 93 fourth generation Japanese-American females at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Analyses of the results indicate that the sample group recognizes cultural similarity to more than one ethnic group in Hawaii. Also, participants self-identified with their Japanese ethnocultural heritage and traditions from moderate to strong on the various indices of the JMIEIS. Attitudes toward verbal behavior refuted paradigms that women should be verbally submissive or placed in culturally defined roles. Instead, women were viewed as eloquent and effective speakers.","2003","2022-10-05 18:16:42","2022-10-05 18:16:42","2022-10-05 18:16:42","","104","","","","","Ethnocultural Identity and Verbal Behavior Attitudes","","","","","University of Hawai'i at Manoa","United States -- Hawaii","English","Copyright ProQuest Dissertations Publishing 2003","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798460469529","","","","","Ethnocultural identity; Fourth Generation; Japanese-American; Verbal behavior attitudes; Yonsei","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Secondly, the paper seeks to identify and gauge the effects of power hierarchy and bureaucracy in Vietnamese organizations. Lastly, this study aims to explore the relationship between hierarchy of power on the creativity level among employees.         Summary: This thesis relies on qualitative research method to attain its objectives mentioned above. Four in-depth interviews were conducted with top-level managers who are working in Vietnam. These interviews aim to evaluate the impact of cultural factors on the presence of power hierarchy in organizations. Also, the relationship between hierarchy of power and organizational creativity in Vietnam is examined based the participants’ perspectives. Certain insights are generated from the interview result, which provides a comprehensive study of power hierarchy and employees’ creativity in organizations from a cultural perspective. A discussion of the findings in this thesis and related arguments by previous scholars is also presented to more elaborately study how creativity is affected by organizational hierarchy.         Conclusions: The findings in this research imply that the hierarchy of power is greatly influenced by the national culture of the country that the organization operates. In addition, power hierarchy has strong impacts on employees’ willingness to raise their voice, which eventually affects the development of organizational creativity. Generally, organizations in Vietnam adopt steep hierarchy of power where the gap between superiors and subordinates is significant, which might impede employees’ creativity and innovation. However, the contingency theory is also supported as this study implies that the impact of power hierarchy varies due to the uniqueness and different objectives of each organization. Certain level of hierarchy is still required to ensure effective operation and avoid chaos among employees.","2018","2022-10-05 18:19:20","2022-10-05 18:19:24","2022-10-05 18:19:20","","","","","","","The impact of power hierarchy on fostering innovation and creativity among employees in Vietnam","","","","","","","en","","","","","aaltodoc.aalto.fi","","Accepted: 2018-09-10T09:24:17Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"7JXIH4UW","thesis","","Ngwenya, Faithful","Power and Authority as an Aspect of School Effectiveness","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2568222927/abstract/A6839C4AA5A74408PQ/1","The study of power and authority in a school may present problems as it is difficult to pin down and define within the school environment. Educators from the sample school seem to realize the importance of power and authority in the running of their schools. They however complain about the misdirected exercise of power and authority by the principals. Some pointed out that democracy does not exist in the management of their schools. The educators further complain about the unfair and inconsistent use of power by school managers. They claimed that with such power principals intimidate and victimize those educators that challenge their authority. The majority complain about the general lack of good managerial relations in the school that lead to mediocre performance and a high educator turn over. The purpose of this study is to explore how power relations manifest itself in school management and also to explore the impact of power and authority on school effectiveness. The study attempted to answer the questions: • How do power relations manifest itself in school management? • To what extent can power relations contribute to effective school management? The researcher wanted to further explore innovative ways to use power and authority to the enhancement of school effectiveness thereby addressing complaints and concerns raised by educators. It was also the intention of the researcher to find ways of changing the negative connotations of power to positive ones that bring educators and other school stakeholders together rather than set them apart. Power is synonymous with management; so it is important for the study to explore avenues that will direct the good use of power and authority to benefit the school as an organization. A qualitative research approach was adopted for the study to enable the researcher to explore the experiences, feelings and perceptions of the educators of power and authority. The researcher then purposively selected educators, office staff and Heads of Departments (HODs) to have a wider and richer assortment of experiences for a reliable data reservoir. Interviews were conducted and observations done. Data was then transcribed, coded and analyzed. After the data analysis; the researcher found that power and authority is a prerequisite for effective school management but its limitations hinder the manifestation of power relations in schools. Educators felt that they were powerless because their power and authority is limited only to classroom management. They argued that the limitation of power inhibits them from freely exercising their power and authority as educators in a democratic environment. Another finding revealed that power relations and effective school management should manifest through the participative empowerment of subordinates. The findings further revealed that power sharing through a consistently fair and democratic system builds an effective school.","","2022-10-05 18:19:53","2022-10-05 18:19:53","2022-10-05 18:19:53","","119","","","","","","","","","","University of Johannesburg (South Africa)","South Africa","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.Ed.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798738680519","","","","","Leadership; Communication; Behavior; Decision making; Planning; Ethics; Education; Interviews; Validity; Political power; Democracy; Accountability; Qualitative research; Public policy; Data analysis; Philosophy; Public schools; Data collection; Research methodology; Codes; Consent; Departments; Education policy; Educational administration; Managers; School effectiveness; School principals; Teachers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"MTKSXSDU","thesis","1987","Nicholls, Gordon Charles","A study of the process of professionalisation of teacher educators at colleges of education, with special reference to public policy, organisation and professional association.","","","","","https://researchspace.ukzn.ac.za/handle/10413/10006","The last decade has seen an increase in the  institutionalised professionalisation of the White teachers  in the Republic of South Africa. In 1981 the de Lange  Commission called for the professionalisation of teacher  educators and this was accepted by the Government in the  White Paper of 1983. Subsequently teacher educators have  been compelled by the National Education Policy Amendment  Act (House of Assembly), 1986 (Act 103 of 1986) to register  with the Teachers' Federal Council and financial pressure  was brought to bear under the Act for teacher educators to  associate with recognised teacher organisations. The outcome  of this requirement appears to be greater control of the  profession by the Government.  It is timely to investigate precisely what is understood by  professionalisation vis-a-vis teacher educators, as the  professionalisation of teacher educators cannot be  accomplished by statutory fiat alone. Nor have teacher  educators held a particularly professional position within  education. The colleges of education have been hemmed in by  the provincial authorities on the one hand and by the  powerful university lobby on the other. Colleges of  education have historically been associated with secondary  education and still are, in that they are controlled by the  provincial authorities and have not been accorded full  tertiary status and standing within the educational  organisational structures. The colleges of education  per se have no representation and no direct input into  policy making and planning for education in South Africa. It  is relevant and urgent to ask questions such as ""What is  meant by the professionalisation of teacher educators?"",  ""What process is involved in professionalisation?"" and ""How  can the increased professionalisation of teacher educators  be realistically accomplished in the Republic of South  Africa?"" To this end, a full exposition of the concept of  professionalisation is derived from the literature. The  phenomenon and process of professionalisation are thoroughly  considered, mainly from a theoretical sociological  perspective. A relatively recent history of important events  in Education within the Republic of South Africa is  considered in the light of the possibilities for furthering  the process of the professionalisation of teacher educators  in this country,. In particular, the implications of the  recommendations of the De Lange Commission (1981) and the  Government's reaction to this Commision, as contained in the  White Paper (1983), are considered. The South African  Teachers' Council for Whites and its impact is assessed, and  the implications of the 1983 Constitution are considered, as  they affect teacher education in the Republic of South  Africa.  All the facets and factors implicit in the process of the  professionalisation of teacher educators are critically  reviewed via the attributive and process paradigms of  professionalisation as explicated by Ozyga and Lawn.  Recommendations are generated based on the insights  obtained. In particular two facets of paramount importance  emerged : (i) The need for an organised professional teacher  educator association, to promote professional concerns and  to represent professional interests in educational  provisioning, is essential; and  (ii) The need for the Government to reorganise its  educational structures, so as to afford teacher educators a  channel of professional representation, is evident.  These facets would be of mutual value to the profession and  the Government alike.  Current education structures are sketched and futuristic  idealistic models of organisational structures are proposed.  On the basis of these studies a number of recommendations  are proposed, including, inter alia, the following primary  facets : Teacher education should be occupationally delineated, its  members should be incorporated in a distinct and discrete  professional registration category and statutory recognition  should be given to this profession and its members;  Teacher educators should form a fully developed national  professional association to promote individual and corporate  interests and to negotiate on matters of interest and  concern;  The teacher education profession should be rationalised and  coordinated nationally, be accorded a greater degree of  professional autonomy and be formally involved in national  policy making in a unitary general affairs body;  Teacher education should be upgraded to a fully degreed  profession, with specialised post graduate degrees being  made available with a specific bearing on teacher education,  including the opportunity for research; and  The courses offered by colleges of education should be  upgraded via establishing the option of degree courses at  colleges, concentrating all teacher training at colleges of  education, providing enhanced facilities for serving  teachers to upgrade their qualifications at colleges,  promoting a wider acceptance and implementation of  integrated teacher training degree courses and promoting the  esteem of teaching degree and diploma courses as  professional and academic qualifications of repute.","1987","2022-10-05 18:20:58","2022-10-05 18:20:58","2022-10-05 18:20:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_ZA","","Thesis","","","researchspace.ukzn.ac.za","","Accepted: 2013-11-15T06:41:21Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this essay, we address the question by developing a ?new standards typology? articulated around two axes: agency denial and hierarchy. These refer respectively to the unilateral shaping of standards applicable to others, and to the salience of Eurocentricism in the way the standards are enforced and structure the international system. Ultimately, we argue that in transforming their ?continent? from a metropolis to a microcosmos ? from a cluster of colonial capitals to an EU that contains many of the world?s tensions within itself ? Europeans have only partially succeeded in transcending their colonial impulses. We conclude by suggesting that the EU?s relevance is grounded in its ability to become a post-colonial power, and that to achieve this, those acting in its name need to remember historical legacies and reflect upon the ?standards? that inspire their action.","2014-06-01","2022-10-05 18:21:07","2022-10-05 18:21:07","2022-10-05 18:21:07","718-745","","3","42","","","From Metropolis to Microcosmos","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I start with the premise that international states are social actors and are nested within informal social networks of friendly and conflictual relationships. Rather than lateral relationships among equals, networks among states tend to have a vertical or hierarchical structure. Although international hierarchical relationships may arise as a result of material power asymmetries, this article focuses on non-material asymmetries that stem from political legitimacy or policy innovation ? a subject that has received less attention in scholarly research. I argue that, within these hierarchies, states adopt one of two roles ? a dominant or a subordinate. Each resulting (dyadic) dominant?subordinate relationship is a social contract, in which the subordinate concedes some autonomy in exchange for the dominant?s protection. This social hierarchy affects the relationships among subordinates, as well as between a dominant and subordinates. The model predicts that a state?s degree of subordination reduces its probability of conflict initiation against other subordinates. Moreover, the decision to initiate conflict is influenced by the expectation that the dominant will intervene, which itself is affected by the target?s relative level of subordination to the dominant vis-à-vis the challenger. These predictions are supported by empirical analyses of the US hierarchy (1950?2000).","2016-09-01","2022-10-05 18:21:14","2022-10-05 18:21:14","2022-10-05 18:21:14","665-679","","5","53","","","The return on social bonds","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This “convergence argument” is tested with a sample of 61 public and 61 private organizations in the Netherlands. We analyze whether public organizations, after 20 years of NPM reform, have changed their organizational structures and internal policies in relation to competitive, regulatory, and autonomy pressures, similarly to private organizations. Statistical analyses show that competition increases the incidence of change both in public and private organizations. High managerial autonomy and exposure to regulatory pressures relate to increased incidence of change in public organizations, but not in private ones. The results support the idea that NPM reform has made public organizations more similar to private organizations but that some concrete differences persist between private and public management in the Netherlands.","2013-07-01","2022-10-06 02:56:55","2022-10-06 02:56:55","2022-10-06 02:56:55","735-754","","3","23","","Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory","After the Reform","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, to account for the need of sustainable development, organizations must foster innovative solutions and find new ways to operate. By using the approach of open innovation, and thereby go beyond the organization’s own boundaries, organizations can obtain external resources to stay competitive and innovative. This thesis aims to contribute to the literature on open innovation by investigating the approach in a new context - the Positive Footprint Housing context (PFH). PFH is a cross-sectional research platform between academia and industry, with the purpose to generate new and more sustainable ways of designing housing projects. The platform’s outputs are currently being realized in three housing projects, which thereby function as full-scale laboratories for implementing sustainable housing. In particular, the study aims at identifying and analyzing the challenges the PFH platform has encountered, from a management point of view. To be able to achieve the purpose of the study, an inductive and qualitative research strategy have been used, and data collection has been made through interviews, observations and documents. Furthermore, a literature review was undertaken in order to form a theoretical framework related to the research problem, which was used to support and enhance the analysis. The findings of the study show that the greatest challenges from a management point of view in the PFH platform are concerned with how to lead and organize a group with various actors involved, coming from widely spread organizations and having different goals and ways of working. Moreover, the literature shows that specific context characteristics have an impact on open innovation collaborations. In the construction industry, the high complexity as well as the high variety of actors, constitute as factors that bring difficulties for innovation in the industry. The analysis shows that the PFH platform have been a successful project in the sense that it has been a functional collaboration that have resulted in several sustainability-oriented solutions. Although it can be hard working with open innovation due to the variety of the actors involved, the PFH collaboration seems to have benefited the members of the group. It seems as there are some factors that function as enablers for the platform, namely innovation broker, management engagement, demonstration projects etc., which therefore could be considered to be critical for the future of the PFH platform. The findings of this thesis could contribute to the literature on open innovation by filling the gap of case studies on open innovation within the construction industry, in the context of sustainability, and thereby provide new insights of how innovative and sustainable solutions can be implemented in a construction project.","2018","2022-10-06 03:03:57","2022-10-06 03:04:08","2022-10-06 03:03:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","odr.chalmers.se","","Accepted: 2019-07-03T14:52:42Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An abundant literature supports such a claim even when controls are introduced for such things as the income of the single parent, the educational attainment of the single parent, the years spent in a single-parent family, the age at which the disruption of the child's family occurred (in the case of divorce or separation), the type of single-parent family (divorced/never-married parent), the child's race, and a host of other, seemingly important background factors. Still, the attainment deficits persist. In this article an explanation for part of this deficit is advanced. It is proposed that one reason why children of one-parent families achieve less as adults is that they lack exposure to hierarchical models of authority relations in their families. The family serves as the prototype of all authority relationships. By virtue of living in nonhierarchical families, children from single-parent households are handicapped in their ability to function in institutions that are fundamentally hierarchical, namely, education, the economy, and occupations.","1988","2022-10-06 03:06:26","2022-10-06 03:06:26","2022-10-06 03:06:26","957-966","","4","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [Wiley, National Council on Family Relations]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine structures of networks on the Internet Dark Net (Virtual) and compare it to network structures of traditional black markets (Ground), using agent-based modeling. The purpose of modeling these two different types of illicit markets is to understand the network structure that emerges from the interactions of the agents in each environment. Traditional black markets are relatively hierarchical, with high degree and high betweenness. We compare the density and average length of the shortest path of the simulated Ground black market networks with our simulated Virtual network.

However, defining and comparing the dominance profile of social groups is difficult due to the different dominance measures used and because no one measure explains it all. We applied different analytical methods to winner-loser sociomatrices to determine the dominance profile of five groups of wild lemurs (species: Lemur catta, Propithecus verreauxi, and Eulemur rufus x collaris) from the Berenty forest (Madagascar). They are an excellent study model because they share the same habitat and an apparently similar dominance profile: linear hierarchy and female dominance. Data were collected over more than 1200 h of observation. Our approach included four steps: (1) by applying the binary dyadic dominance relationship method (I&SI) on either aggressions or supplant sociomatrices we verified whether hierarchy was aggression or submission based; (2) by calculating normalized David’s scores and measuring steepness from aggression sociomatrices we evaluated whether hierarchy was shallow or steep; (3) by comparing the ranking orders obtained with methods 1 and 2 we assessed whether hierarchy was consistent or not; and (4) by assessing triangle transitivity and comparing it with the linearity index and the level of group cohesion we determined if hierarchy was more or less cohesive. Our results show that L. catta groups have got a steep, consistent, highly transitive and cohesive hierarchy. P. verreauxi groups are characterized by a moderately steep and consistent hierarchy, with variable levels of triangle transitivity and cohesion. E. rufus x collaris group possesses a shallow and inconsistent hierarchy, with lower (but not lowest) levels of transitivity and cohesion. A multiple analytical approach on winner-loser sociomatrices other than leading to an in-depth description of the dominance profile, allows intergroup and cross-species comparisons.","2015-01-15","2022-10-06 03:08:20","2022-10-06 03:08:20","2022-10-06 03:08:20","e729","","","3","","PeerJ","The socio-matrix reloaded","","","","","","","en","","","","","peerj.com","","Publisher: PeerJ Inc.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A secondary objective was to determine relationships between respondents' characteristics and their perceptions of extension performance. Data pointed to a rather low judgment of extension performance under both approaches for all the performance indicators defined for this study. On a scale ranging from 0 to 5, general extension mean scores were higher than T&V on all indicators, except one: (a) service conditions 2.4 $>$ 2.2; (b) research-extension linkage: 1.5 $>$ 1.4; (c) farmer participation: 2.9 $>$ 2.7: (d) effectiveness of methods: 2.4 $>$ 2.1; (e) adequacy of job skills: 2.7 $>$ 2.6; (f) logistics/support services: 2.2 $<$ 2.5. In addition, there were no significant differences between the two approaches. Level of formal education was negatively related to years of work experience indicating that older, experienced officers are generally lacking in formal agricultural training. Low, insignificant relationships were observed between respondents' perceived adequacy of job skills and days of inservice training years of extension experience and formal education. Type of extension approach had low and insignificant relationships with all the dependent variable scores. Overall, the results of the study indicated lack of performance improvements regarding research-extension linkages, support services, organizing farmer participation, effectiveness of methods, and training. The generous allocation of funds to T&V projects ensured that better service conditions, vehicles and other logistics were adequately provided for greater part of project period. However, converting these resources into actual capacity to perform has produced, at best, mixed results. Despite the comparatively greater political and financial support given to T&V, its performance failed to surpass that of the general extension it purports to replace. The research identified training, research-extension linkages, and monitoring and evaluation as major extension management issues that require attention. Specifically, the study revealed a need for comprehensive training programs in supervisory and administrative skills, as well as applied extension education methodologies and communication for all officers. The social science and behavioral skills of extension workers need to be upgraded, since much of their work involves human relations and community activities.

Volumes of literature exists that explains categories of cross-cultural differences, but little research existed that would identify the ethical behavioral choice differences between these two groups. The purpose of this quantitative descriptive study was to investigate culturally based ethical choice differences between Chinese and American business students on hypothetical situations contained in the Personal Business Ethics Survey (PBES). Using an investigator-developed, 52 closed-ended question survey based on a five-point Likert-type scale enabled the researcher to investigate if ethical choice differences existed between American and Chinese university business students. The study results supported the alternate hypotheses in both cases. Based on the participants in this study, American business major students responded significantly more ethically than Chinese business student majors. Additionally, the results indicated that the cultural aspects of building relationships and saving face significantly influenced the ethical choices of Chinese participants, but held no significant influence in the ethical choices of American students. This study provides significant and robust new cross-cultural insights into the behavioral choice outcomes of Chinese and American student’s ethical decision processes. These results will enable the multinational business arena to develop effective policies and procedures that will enhance ethical best business practices across cultures.

Because a fast scheduling method is required, look-ahead heuristics are traditionally used to solve these kinds of problems. As an alternative, we introduce an agent-based approach where intelligent vehicle agents schedule their own routes. They interact with job agents, who strive for minimum transportation costs, using a Vickrey auction for each incoming order. This approach offers several advantages: it is fast, requires relatively little information and facilitates easy schedule adjustments in reaction to information updates. We compare the agent-based approach to more traditional hierarchical heuristics in an extensive simulation experiment. We find that a properly designed multi-agent approach performs as good as or even better than traditional methods. Particularly, the multi-agent approach yields less empty miles and a more stable service level.","2007-08-16","2022-10-06 03:10:54","2022-10-06 03:10:54","2022-10-06 03:10:54","59-75","","1","181","","European Journal of Operational Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Multi-agent systems; Transportation; Auctions/bidding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beginning in the early 1970s, spontaneous colonization occurred on squattered lands located adjacent to oil company roads and in government development sectors composed of multiple 50 ha land parcels organized into “piano key” shaped family farms or fincas. Since fincas are managed at the household level as spatially discrete, temporally independent units, land conversion at the finca-level is recognized as the chief proximate cause of deforestation within the region. Focusing on the spatial and temporal dynamics of deforestation, agricultural extensification, and plant succession at the finca-level, and urbanization at the community-level, cell-based morphogenetic models of LandUse and LandCover Change (LULCC) were developed as the foundation for predictive models of regional LULCC dynamics and landscape diversity. Two cellular automata models were developed and used to integrate biophysical, geographical, and social variables to characterize temporally dynamic landscapes. The human, geographical, and biophysical dimensions of land use and land cover change were examined, specifically deforestation, anthropogenic extensification, and reforestation. Remotely-sensed data ranging temporally from the 1970s through 1999, combined with thematic map coverages of biophysical gradients and geographical accessibility, were linked to household and community survey data collected in 1990 and 1999. Image processing techniques for LULC characterization and spatial analyses of landscape structure were used to assess the rate and nature of LULCC throughout the time-series. In addition, LULC and LULCC associated with secondary plant succession and agricultural extensification were assessed and simulated for specific landscape strata and study area locations related to development corridors along transportation networks and expanding urban environments. The presented research combines household survey data with biophysical and geographical data through a spatio-temporal modeling context that links complexity theory and landscape ecology to a GIS and remote sensing analytical framework to increase the understanding of landscape dynamics across time, space, and landscape strata.","","2022-10-06 03:12:00","2022-10-06 03:12:00","2022-10-06 03:12:00","","275","","","","","A complex systems approach to dynamic spatial simulation modeling","","","","","The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","United States -- North Carolina","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493173689","","","","","Social sciences; Complex systems; Land use; Deforestation; Applied sciences; Health and environmental sciences; Amazon; Dynamic spatial simulation modeling; Earth sciences; Ecuadorian","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results indicated that STS symptoms were common among the south Georgia CPS workers who were surveyed. CPS workers with more years of experience were more likely to suffer from severe anxiety, unremitting and irresistible thoughts, impulses, and actions than those workers with less experience. Workers who worked longer hours were more likely to suffer from more severe STS symptoms than workers who only worked 40 hours per week. Female workers reported experiencing more symptoms than their male counterparts, but male workers also reported being symptomatic. Workers who grew up in families with enmeshed interaction patterns suffered from intrusive symptoms where as those who grew up in disengaged families suffered from psychoticism symptoms.

While the development of ICT and other supportive systems has helped modern workers to become mobile and enabled remote and distributed working, the development of worker performance has been lacking. The problem of improving worker performance is multifaceted and cross-disciplinary in nature. For example, in order to be productive, the modern worker must be motivated and competent to do the job, and to be supported by appropriate facilities and ICT tools. All the factors that together contribute to the performance of the knowledge workers can be fitted under the concept of workplace. Traditionally, the workplace has represented real estate and has consisted only of the buildings in which people work. In this study, however, workplace is seen as a bundle of services instead of being simply a fixed place. These services are aimed at supporting the workers and they are called workplace services. The primary objective of this study is to create new understanding of the workplace concept and to provide guidelines for future workplace development. As an empirical contribution, this study explores and identifies issues that prevent the workplace services from being transformed towards integrated service packages. Additionally, due to the integral nature of the worker in the workplace services setting, this study brings light to issues concerning the workers' significance in the workplace service provision. This study is a qualitative one, the empirical data of which consists of 27 semi-structured interviews. The interviews were performed with representatives of facility service providers. The goal of the interviews was to gain new understanding of the interorganizational relationships of service providers, and to better understand other actors within the workplace from the service provider point of view. The interviews also sought to understand the role of the worker within the workplace service setting from the service provider point of view. The results of this study indicate that service provider relationships to all workplace actors need to be developed to a more collaborative direction. Increased collaboration helps all parties, instead of minimizing their own costs, to maximize the value created for the most important workplace actor, the worker. This study also finds that the client, as the employer of the workers and they paying customer for most workplace services, has an integral role in workplace development. In the future, better understanding of the needs of workers as well as assuming a worker-oriented approach to workplace development is necessary. In order to develop the workplace, collaborative efforts between all parties are needed. Due to the multifaceted nature of the workplace, collaboration across functional and organizational boundaries will also be necessary.","2007","2022-10-06 03:16:46","2022-10-06 03:17:06","2022-10-06 03:16:46","","","","","","","Interorganizational relationships of facility service providers","","","","","Teknillinen korkeakoulu","","en","openAccess","","","","aaltodoc.aalto.fi","","Accepted: 2011-10-25T07:47:02Z ISSN: 1795-8857","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Other studies of hierarchical gift exchange in the region have failed to notice the salience of funeral gifting, which is actually the most prestigious form of reciprocity because it allies the living with the dead, who in turn aid the living and ensure the integrity of all other exchanges in the hierarchy. This paper examines this relationship by analyzing case studies of funerary practice from four different Voltaic societies, with a special focus on the Mossi empire of Burkina Faso. The thesis concludes by exploring how the findings reveal the relevance of religious studies to understanding the economic dimension of ritual behavior and the ritual ends of much economic exchange.","","2022-10-06 03:17:52","2022-10-06 03:17:52","2022-10-06 03:17:51","","79","","","","","","","","","","The Florida State University","United States -- Florida","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780355327311","","","","","Social sciences; Philosophy; religion and theology; Funerals; Mossi; Spheres of exchange; Volta basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Institutional histories of English Studies focus almost exclusively on theoretical conflicts within literary studies. Composition's contributions to the discipline and its concern with student work and pedagogical practice have been neglected. Consequently, the ""pedagogical arts of the contact zone,"" which Pratt sees as necessary to a multicultural interchange, have not been developed. By reintroducing composition and its concerns into the discussion of the discipline's history, this examination shows how the range of representations accorded the populace materially shapes what English Studies is and the way it does its work. Juxtaposing Matthew Arnold's foundational representation of the populace as a threat with the reports he wrote as an Inspector of Schools disturbs the prevalent view that Arnold sought to invent a discipline solely concerned with controlling an unknowing and largely unfeeling mass. Subsequent figurations of the populace in projects as diverse as the Great Books Program, British Cultural Studies at the Open University, and recent ethnographic initiatives demonstrate how little the range of opposing approaches to English Studies have differed in their construction of the populace as objects for reform rather than as knowing and responding subjects. Exploring the pedagogical practices affiliated with these divergent programs shows that the figure of the populace serves the contradictory function of simultaneously fostering and undermining initiatives to educate the very populace being represented. Considering pedagogical practice in relation to specific curricular and institutional constraints surfaces the limits and constitutive disjunctions in dominant conceptions of the populace. Learning how to read and respond to student work, while necessary, is not sufficient in itself to alter the current impasse in the discipline: coordinated institutional and curricular changes at the local level must also occur if English Studies is to develop an educational program that promotes the range of literate practices required in a multicultural society.","","2022-10-06 03:18:11","2022-10-06 03:18:11","2022-10-06 03:18:11","","282","","","","","Representing the people","","","","","University of Pittsburgh","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798208325216","","","","","Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For them, politics is a consequence of the fall, and any authority pattern in the socio-political arena was not part of the original creation. In this work, the author argues to the contrary for the possibility of a created political life without sin. Sinful politics of this world is seen as distorted politics after the fall. Despite its corruption, nevertheless, we can maintain a future hope for the redemption of sinful politics. This work heavily relies on the works of the Dutch Neo-Calvinists--Abraham Kuyper, Herman Bavinck, and Herman Dooyeweerd--and their intellectual heirs of both North America and Europe. Their positive view of politics and active political engagement are partly the effect of the Reformational viewpoint that politics is a ""pre-lapsarian phenomenon"" rather than an ""epi-phenomenon of sin."" In this perspective, politics can take three different forms: politics without sin, politics within sin, and politics beyond sin. And at the same time, politics has its ontological basis in the Garden, is here and now in this world, and will be in the New Jerusalem after the Last Day. The main body of this work discusses the following hypotheses: (1) Politics is a part of the creational order. It is the human response to the divine cultural mandate. (2) Human beings as God's image are political agents in the divine-human, human-to-human, and human-nature relationships. (3) The power of sin has permeated into political agents and political institutions. This is the sinful distortion of politics. (4) The state has a paradoxical nature, as is represented by the biblical symbols of the ""magistrate"" and the ""beast."" (5) The cause of this paradox can be traced to ""the principalities and the powers."" These spiritual beings influence political agents and political institutions. (6) Christ Jesus was a political man who has opened the possibility of redeeming politics based on servanthood and loving kindness. (7) Christ's second coming will perfectly redeem politics.

Harnessing the idea of student involvement and engagement in live projects to their architectural education is difficult. Attempting to define what a live project actually is in this situation has required a lot of self-searching by architectural educators. Whilst it is an accepted condition of mainstream practice that timescale, budget and brief are matched with intention and design before works starts on site, it is not at all clear that such a definitive bounding of the project is in the students’ best interest in a learning environment. This paper looks at the work of the Architecture of Rapid Change and Scarce Resources (ARCSR) research cluster, and assesses the relationship between boundary setting and changing intentions; speculating on the effect of changing intentions on the education of the student. The value of live projects for students involves to a large extent the value of the present moment of active engagement with concrete reality. With the rising cost of university education and a parallel increase in the adoption of live projects at architecture schools, new approaches to learning are required that operate on a different set of principles to those geared towards training architects for large scale, office based practice. Students should be encouraged to experiment and innovate using incremental, iterative and reflective processes embedded in a real setting and tested in the present.","2016-04","2022-10-06 03:21:04","2022-10-06 03:21:04","2022-10-06 03:21:04","","","1","8","","","Live projects","","","","","","","en","","","","","repository.londonmet.ac.uk","","Number: 1 Publisher: Oxford Brookes University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A cross -cultural study of Sessue Hayakawa's silent stardom","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/305315062/abstract/6A7A0B86C7D44D4PQ/1","Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa (1886–1973) was the only non-Caucasian film star in the US from 1915 until 1922. Examining Hayakawa's film stardom and transnational reception, this dissertation traces the volatile intersections between Japanese and (white) American cultures. It casts light on the historical trajectory of American images of Japan, and of Japanese self-images in the world. First, this dissertation interprets Hayakawa's stardom in terms of Japan's middle ground position between the “white” and the “non-white” in a racial and cultural hierarchy in middle-class American discourse. The popularity of Japonisme, as well as Japan's rapid modernization, influenced perceptions of the Japanese as being more advanced than other “primitive” races and cultures and thus closer to Europeans and Americans. The legal racialization of Japanese as non-white would not be completed until the Supreme Court defined Japanese as “aliens ineligible to citizenship” in 1922. Second, this dissertation examines the cross-cultural reception of Hayakawa's stardom in the context of globalization of the film culture. Within the US, Japanese immigrants who were resisting against the anti-Japanese movement rearticulated the star's appeal as an ideal model of assimilation to American society. Across the Pacific, Japanese government officials, educators, and intellectuals, who were pursuing the Pure Film Movement to effect broader modernization and to articulate Japanese national and cultural identity, appropriated Hayakawa's star image as an ideal representative of modernized Japan. Following W. E. B. DuBois's concept of “double consciousness,” this dissertation articulates Hayakawa's star image as a product of a “triple consciousness.” That is to say, the actor's stardom was formed as a result of his activities as a star/filmmaker and by the reception of American audiences as well as Japanese spectators. Hayakawa not only embodied American stereotypical depictions of Japanese, but also led the Japanese spectators to question, “What is Japanese?” Hayakawa's film stardom emerged as the focal point of ongoing cultural and political negotiations and global power relations, particularly between the US and Japan. In sum, it was formed and interpreted in terms of the struggle to define and control images of Japan on the part of white America and Japanese cultural resistance.","","2022-10-06 03:21:25","2022-10-06 03:21:25","2022-10-06 03:21:25","","771","","","","","“East is East and West is West”?","","","","","New York University","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780496371501","","","","","Social sciences; Language; Cross-cultural; Communication and the arts; literature and linguistics; Nationalism; Japanese-American; Hayakawa; Orientalism; Sessue; Silent stardom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response to this need,  the study’s purpose is to explore and identify ways through which schools within rural contexts  identify and mobilise resources. It focuses on the nature of resources within the rural context,  the strategies used for identifying and mobilising resources within rural contexts, and the  conditions that are conducive to the successful application of strategies used for identifying  and mobilising resources for supporting educational processes, as well as the challenges  experienced during resource identification and mobilisation. The overarching research question  for this study is: What are possible strategies for identifying and mobilising resources for the  sustainability of schools within rural contexts? The South African Schools Act advises that,  through school leadership which includes school governing bodies (SGBs) and school  management, schools are required to supplement resources provided by the State (RSA,  1996b). However, this study discovered a gap in the literature, in terms of how school leaders  and school stakeholders can identify and mobilise resources for the sustainability of schools  within rural contexts. This is a qualitative study, underpinned by Critical Emancipatory  research (CER), which has its foundations in the critical theory paradigm. To understand the  issue of resources, the study draws from the asset-based approach and resource mobilisation as  its theoretical underpinning guided by traditions of participatory research and critical  emancipatory research, Free Attitude Interviews (FAI), SWOT analysis and Transect walks  coupled with photovoice were used to generate data.  Through transect walks and photovoice, this study identified crucial resources and approaches  or strategies for resource identification and mobilisation which are suitable for the context of  rurality. These resources include local businesses, government and non-government  organisations, traditional leadership, parents, school history and other organisations as crucial  providers of material and human resources. The key strategies for assets identification and  mobilisation were found to be the creation of school-community relations, schools’ consistency  in producing good results, participation in multi-stakeholder engagements and forums, running  schools like businesses and building from schools’ rich history. The study also identifies conditions   that are conducive to the successful application of resource mobilisation and the  challenges thereof. The key findings of this study revealed that resources are not always  situated far from rural communities and schools as the prevailing discourse on rurality and  availability of resources has always suggested. Informed by findings, the study proposes four  stages that schools can use towards identifying and mobilising resources. The stages aim at  consolidating and presenting all discussions made in chapter five and six thereby creating a  meaning as to how the asset-based approach and resource mobilisation theory may be utilised  in the mobilisation of resources. The proposed stages, as I indicated above, link with all areas  discussed in this study, which includes identifying the nature of resources within rural contexts,  identifying strategies for identifying and mobilising resources within rural contexts and  creating conditions conducive to the successful application of strategies for identifying and  mobilising resources. Finally, the last stage involves identifying challenges for resource  identification and mobilisation.","2018","2022-10-06 03:21:35","2022-10-06 03:21:35","2022-10-06 03:21:35","","","","","","","Resource mobilisation for the sustainability of schools within rural context","","","","","","","en","","Thesis","","","researchspace.ukzn.ac.za","","Accepted: 2020-04-07T10:11:31Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"XR9I67BS","thesis","2012","Momberg, Dinele","The role of environmental knowledge and information in young female consumers’ selection and evaluation of environmentally friendly apparel","","","","","https://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/26617","Textiles and clothing represent the world’s second largest industry, which also makes this industry one of the most polluting industries in the world, and therefore this industry should reconsider its practices in respect of the environmental impact it has. The entire life cycle of an apparel item has an impact on the environment, from the product design stage to the disposal of an apparel product. Environmentally friendly apparel products refer to apparel products which have been created with consideration of the environmental impact of the production process. The consumer’s apparel decision-making process consists of five stages, namely: awareness, interest, evaluation of alternatives, decision and post-buying response. Buyer behaviour is inherently determined by a consumer’s knowledge or extra information that a consumer obtains. The acquisition of environmentally friendly apparel is therefore influenced by environmental knowledge. It is consequently crucial to provide consumers with relevant information regarding the environmental impact of their apparel consumption choices in order to facilitate consumers in making more environmental friendly apparel decisions. Very limited research exists on consumers’ environmentally friendly apparel purchasing practices, especially in the South African context. Insufficient literature also exists regarding the role of environmental knowledge and information source exposure in the acquisition of environmentally friendly apparel. The purpose of the research was to explore and describe how environmental knowledge and exposure to information about environmental issues are reflected in consumers’ choice of apparel products. A qualitative approach was used to explore young female consumers’ existing levels of environmental knowledge, and whether that environmental knowledge is reflected in the evaluation and selection of apparel as well as the role environmental information plays on their purchase decision. Non-probability purposive sampling was used to ensure the inclusion of young female students (19–22 years old, n = 29). Participants first had to write an essay on the subject of pertinent environmental issues and then participated in a focus group discussion on the evaluation and selection of a t-shirt. Results suggest that the participants have general environmental knowledge. They have the ability to identify environmental problems as well as the causes and consequences of these environmental problems. However, participants’ environmental awareness and their knowledge pertaining to the actual production and supply of environment-friendly apparel in the South African context were very limited. The results also highlight the product attributes important to the participants when evaluating and selecting apparel such as price, aesthetics and functionality of the garment, but environmental attributes such as organic cotton, locally produced, reduced waste techniques and not using harmful chemicals did not feature high under the attributes participants considered. They prioritized price, aesthetics and fit above other attributes (including environmental attributes). Environmental knowledge was not consciously considered in their general apparel decision-making, even though participants indicated that they do care about the environment. It also seems that information source exposure relating to the environmental impact of clothing had no effect on their purchase decision process. When probed, certain barriers emerged that prevented the participants from using environmental knowledge or the information source exposure in their decision-making. These barriers are: the relevance of non-environmentally related product attributes, the availability of environmentally friendly apparel, a lack of relevant knowledge, and perceived consumer effectiveness. While the study had certain limitations, the findings should be valuable to manufacturers, retailers and marketers of environmentally friendly apparel and further research is needed, especially in the South African context, relating to environmentally friendly apparel and consumer behaviour.

Instead of looking at the “minorities” as accepted categories, the focus is on the discursive, narrative, symbolic practices that influence these very categories and how these processes of becoming ‘marginal’ are interrelated with the various forms of space (“cultural,” “political,” “social”) the citizens inhabit. This project specifically aims to uncover how the identities of the ‘backward classes’ are formed in India in the context of the institutionalized social and cultural patterns. This attempt to understand the formation of marginal identity begins from the historic formation of caste and journeys through the colonial and postcolonial struggles to modern day policies. The Mandal Commission report has been selected as the “policy” that helps to uncover how differences between self and other are constituted, how the social and political realities change meanings in different contexts and how all these “discourses” construct “identity.” The Mandal Commission is, perhaps, the most controversial policy in India, attempting to ensure social justice by reserving slots for higher education and government employment for certain castes of people. The concepts and thoughts of Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault and Henri Lefebvre, along with postcolonial theorists, have been applied to analyze the Mandal report as a discourse that relates back to and is shaped by its history. As state policies affect the processes of identity formation by shaping the power relations between the self and the other , the underlying assumptions and associated norms of the “policy space” has been analyzed and compared with the growing fundamentalist powers as the latter are engaged and have been successful in creating a new “political space” for its participants. The findings indicate that the Mandal operates very differently from the social reality and volatile political environment in its assumptions and recommendations. While it strives to create provisions to assimilate the backward classes into mainstream public life, it also adheres to the system of categorization, which identify and influence the very backwardness.","","2022-10-06 03:36:29","2022-10-06 03:36:29","2022-10-06 03:36:29","","207","","","","","On Becoming Marginal","","","","","Cleveland State University","United States -- Ohio","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493716367","","","","","Social sciences; India; State; Postmodernism; Citizen; Mandal Commission; Marginal; Policy space","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To bring overall effective improvement in administration government has changed their patterns by implementing ICT in different sector of a country and adopting the new concept of e-governance. To reinvent a country‟s whole administration is not an easy task. Most of the developing countries still depend on the paper-based service delivery and the information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure condition is in a very poor situation. For this reason, as a developing country Bangladesh government also has to face many obstacles in implementing e-governance. In this thesis I try to show the barriers of implementing e-governance in Bangladesh and how Bangladesh can achieve a more citizen friendly service through e-governance. This thesis is mainly a theoretical based study. The impact of e-governance in public service is the main concern of this thesis. Here, in this thesis I will be discussing two successful projects of India and Sri Lanka concerning e-governance implementation. The reason behind for giving the example is that as a South Asian neighbour countries both India and Sri Lanka can be a role model for Bangladesh government for implementing e-governance. In the conclusion part, I would try to figure out a collaborated model for smooth running of e-governance operation in Bangladesh. It is nearly impossible for Bangladesh government to run e-governance project alone. This collaboration model is inspired from e-Sri Lanka model of Sri Lankan government. This model is unique and best for implementing in a developing country. Bangladesh government should collaborate with donor institutions and private sector to implement e-governance project in Bangladesh. Under the SICT (Support to ICT Task Force Program Project) project some small project already start to get success, so Bangladesh government should do more research in e-governance for better outcome. Bangladesh government e-governance project should be citizen-centric not techno-centric project. Bangladesh government should plan e-governance project in a way which brings efficiency and effectiveness with countries overall socio-economic development. Bangladesh government should take care of that e-governance project objective should be connected with the countries development objective. Bangladesh government should also take care of that it should never make ambiguous vision for e-governance project with its too little capacity.","2010","2022-10-06 03:36:55","2022-10-06 03:37:00","2022-10-06 03:36:55","","","","","","","E-GOVERNANCE INITIATIVE IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY","","","","","","","eng","CC BY-NC-ND 4.0","","","","osuva.uwasa.fi","","Accepted: 2010-11-08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autistic people are discursively constituted within this cultural context. My goal in this research has been to better understand the dominant and counter discourses constituting autism, how young autistic people themselves embody discursive locations throughout their lives, and how they negotiate the intelligibility of their subject positions. Previous research has looked at how autistic people negotiate diagnoses, whether they feel understood, the discursive positions they embody, and how discourse constitutes their subjectivities. Using a qualitative exploratory research design, I conducted semi-structured interviews with four individuals, ages 22, 23, 23, and 26, who identified as having been labelled as autistic at some point in their life, either by themselves through a self-diagnosis or by a medical professional. I employed thematic analysis and emerging themes were: Diagnosis, Intelligibility, Terminology, Medicalization, Identity, Life Course, and Internalizing Responsibility. This research is significant in its contribution to representations of autistic people’s perspectives. It focuses on people in their 20s and people who do not have formal diagnoses, who have been underrepresented in research. The present research also builds on previous literature by addressing when autistic people lack language to talk about oppression, how they internalize responsibility for social interactions, and their reflections on their futures.","2018-03-16","2022-10-06 03:37:43","2022-10-06 03:37:47","2022-10-06 03:37:43","","","","","","","“By talking about it we can make it a positive thing”","","","","","","","eng","","","","","dr.library.brocku.ca","","Accepted: 2018-03-16T21:34:48Z Publisher: Brock University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the African American church this issue manifests itself through the biblical interpretation of freedom. In light of the victimization of racism, classism and sexism, this dissertation constructs a practical rationale for the historical way that African American women have read the Bible as a source empowerment in their struggle to achieve positions of office and agency in the church and society. This study analyses the oppressive matrix—race, class, and gender—in the Black church and community, as well as the society at large. Three primary questions are explored: (1) How can African American women discover the tools to dismantle oppressive structures that have blocked them from achieving full equality in the church and society? (2) How can they discover their own path to empowerment without destroying the solidarity between them and African American men? (3) How do they develop reading and interpretive strategies of the Bible that will help them read and use its message to empower them in a world where their humanity is not fully valued? The implications of womanist biblical hermeneutics for the empowerment of African American women in the church are established by probing the literature from three historical confluent streams: religion, education, and social reform. The literature is examined through the lens of womanist theological thought in which, the history of African American women is at the center of the analysis. Primary source materials used are slave narratives, biographies, and speeches of African American foremothers and the African American community's memories of the struggle from slavery to the present. The seminal works of womanist thinkers were also used. The final area explicates the practical rationale in the form of womanist biblical hermeneutics: developing practical paradigms of inclusion. The author uses heir own teaching context, New York Theological Seminary, illustratively in this section.","","2022-10-06 03:38:04","2022-10-06 03:38:04","2022-10-06 03:38:04","","286","","","","","Breaking through the blood -stained ceiling","","","","","Teachers College, Columbia University","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493256955","","","","","Social sciences; Philosophy; religion and theology; African-American; Biblical; Church; Empowerment; Hermeneutics; Womanist","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different layers of culture must be distinguished, from individual- to group- to national level. For comparing communication and media around the world data at national level are used that can be compared with different value orientations of people. Several cultural models explain differences in orientation toward time and importance of context. Large scale dimensional models of culture explain more and can help understand how culture operates. The usefulness of such models depends on the constructs, but mostly on the type of questions used. Analysis shows that with that respect the models by Hofstede, Schwartz and GLOBE vary considerably. It shows that the Hofstede model is most appropriate to explain differences in communication styles and media production and usage. Most important dimensions to explain differences in communication are individualism-collectivism, power distance and long-/short-term orientation.","2014","2022-10-06 03:38:26","2022-10-06 03:38:26","2022-10-06 03:38:26","173-204","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-01249-0_6","","","","","Communication Behavior; European Social Survey; Individualistic Culture; Power Distance; Uncertainty Avoidance","de Mooij, Marieke","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After the rise of the women's movement, domestic violence became a social problem and a public concern for lawmakers and criminal prosecutors. As a consequence, several programs were developed to serve the needs of the families involved in domestic violence. This study was conducted to evaluate the views of Latino female participants regarding services provided and satisfaction attending domestic violence programs. Questionnaires in English and Spanish were provided to three different agencies. Thirty-two Latino females participated in the study. The results of this study showed that there is a trend toward a decrease of verbal violence after participants enter into a domestic violence program. Furthermore, receiving more services was related to satisfaction with the program. The results also showed that participants with low incomes often received more services than others with higher incomes.","","2022-10-06 03:38:58","2022-10-06 03:38:58","2022-10-06 03:38:57","","74","","","","","","","","","","California State University, Long Beach","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.S.W.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780496069910","","","","","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research question guiding this study is: How do Mexican-American male Army veterans describe the influences and intersections of Mexican-American culture and Army culture that shaped academic persistence and/or college degree attainment? The problem this study examined is the lack of college degree attainment for Latino men and the failure of the higher education culture to recognize the cultural capital of Mexican-American men to support their educational goals. This study applied Yosso’s (2005) model of community cultural wealth (CCW) as the theoretical framework to inform the research. The use of CCW enabled this research to be examined through a strength-based lens and provide a counter narrative to previous studies which examine the problem form a culturally deprived lens. Merriam (1998) case study approach was as the research method used to gather and analyze the data from a bounded system with a culturally-centered approach focusing on the cuentos (testimony) the four participants provided in forms of interviews and reflective journals. Overall, the key finding of this study is that there are multiple intersections between the home culture and Army culture that influenced academic persistence and degree attainment. This study clearly illustrates how the strengths these four men carried with them from their home culture were made visible by congruent cultural values which were nurtured by Army culture. The findings of this study suggest that capital, when nurtured, significantly impacts one’s concept of self-worth, resiliency, and motivation. Findings from this study can be used to address the structural inequities which still exist in the education culture and shift the discourse and praxis of Latino men’s lack of educational attainment from a deficit approach to a strength-based approach; one that recognizes cultural strengths may not directly align with the dominant culture but when properly leveraged, can lead to maximum educational outcomes.","","2022-10-06 03:39:19","2022-10-06 03:39:19","2022-10-06 03:39:19","","218","","","","","Invisible Strengths","","","","","The University of Texas at San Antonio","United States -- Texas","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780438745988","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology; Education; Academic persistence; Cultural values; Model of community cultural wealth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No region remained untouched by the rebellions and reforms that transformed the country over these years: not least ‘el Gran Nayar’, a 20,000 km2 expanse of mountains and canyons spanning parts of four different states, which constitutes one of Mexico’s most ethnically diverse areas, and is home to one of the country’s most prominent indigenous groups – the Huichols – along with their Cora, Tepehuano, and Mexicanero Indian neighbours. However, despite a boom in regionally-grounded studies of Mexican history, and the long-standing popularity of the Gran Nayar as a site for anthropological research, my book is the first study of the participation of the Gran Nayar’s inhabitants – among the least ‘assimilated’ indigenous groups in the Americas – in the Mexican Revolution. </p> <p>Over the course of this thesis, I show that the Revolution in the Gran Nayar entailed a violent confrontation between an expansionist state and the region’s highly autonomous Indian peasant communities: a clash between practitioners of subsistence agriculture and promoters of capitalist development, rival Indian generations and political factions, and rival visions of the world, of religion, and of daily life. These clashes produced some of the most severe defeats that the Mexican government’s state- and nation-building programmes suffered during this period, with sometimes counter-intuitive consequences. Thus members of ‘traditionalist’ Indian factions, who upheld a resolutely pagan religious tradition and defined themselves in opposition to local mestizos, became an important force within the Catholic-inspired, mestizo-dominated Cristero rebel movements of the 1920s and 30s. Similarly, the Federal educational programmes so often lauded for bringing literacy and ‘progress’ to rural Mexico, instead precipitated violent opposition in the Gran Nayar, which involved the burning of schools, and even the murder of several teachers. And the radical land reforms of left-leaning President Lázaro Cárdenas (1934-40), which proclaimed the liberation of the Mexican peasantry from social and economic oppression, caused violent territorial conflicts between local communities, some of which continue to define life in the region today.</p>","2015","2022-10-06 03:40:37","2022-10-06 03:40:37","2022-10-06 03:40:37","","","","","","","‘The world created anew’","","","","","University of Oxford","","en","","http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","","","ora.ox.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The accessibility of SMS messages over existing mobile networks is high and has almost universal availability even on older and unsophisticated mobile phones and in geographic settings where wireless coverage is weak. There is intensive exploration of this inexpensive mobile telecommunication technology to improve health services and promote behavior change among vulnerable populations. However, a neglected area of research is the documentation and critical analysis of the formative research process required in the development and refinement of effective SMS messages. Objective: The objective of this qualitative research study was to identify major factors that may impact on the effectiveness of evidence-based SMS messages designed to reduce health inequities in hypertension management in low resource settings, including Aboriginal populations in high-income countries and rural populations in low-income countries. Specifically, we were interested in uncovering the range of mediators that impact on appropriate message content transmission and, ultimately, on health behavior improvements in a range of these sociocultural settings. Methods: Collaborative qualitative research with Canadian Aboriginal and Tanzanian participants was conducted to deconstruct the content and transmission of evidence-based health information contained in SMS messages in the context of an international research project designed to address health inequalities in hypertension, and to develop a grounded theory of the major factors that mediate the effectiveness of this communication. We also examined the interrelationship of these mediators with the three essential conditions of the behavior system of the Behavioral Change Wheel model (capability, opportunity, and motivation) and cultural safety. Results: Four focus groups with a total of 45 participants were conducted. Our grounded theory research revealed how discrepancies develop between the evidence-based text message created by researchers and the message received by the recipient in mobile health interventions. These discrepancies were primarily generated by six mediators of meaning in SMS messages:  (1) negative or non-affirming framing of advocacies, (2) fear- or stress-inducing content, (3) oppressive or authoritarian content, (4) incongruity with cultural and traditional practices, (5) disconnect  with the reality of the social determinants of health and the diversity of cultures within a population, and (6) lack of clarity and/or practicality of content. These 6 mediators of meaning provide the basis for sound strategies for message development because they impact directly on the target populations&#8217; capability, opportunity, and motivation for behavior change. Conclusions: The quality of text messages impacts significantly on the effectiveness of a mobile health intervention. Our research underscores the urgent need for interventions to incorporate and evaluate the quality of SMS messages and to examine the mediators of meaning within each targeted cultural and demographic group. Reporting on this aspect of mobile health intervention research will allow researchers to move away from the current black box of SMS text message development, thus improving the transparency of the process as well as the quality of the outcomes.","2016-01-22","2022-10-06 03:42:34","2022-10-06 03:42:34","2022-10-06 03:42:34","e4994","","1","4","","","Unpacking the Black Box","","","","","","","EN","Unless stated otherwise, all articles are open-access distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work (""first published in JMIR mHealth and uHealth..."") is properly cited with original URL and bibliographic citation information.

Used correctly, this understanding could enhance the success rate of organizations. The researcher’s objectives were to answer 4 research questions in order to determine the key attributes that render support networks effective. The research was conducted in 2 parts. (1) Seven subject matter experts on support networks were selected from independent network service providers and from an organization that promotes support networks to its employees. (2) A structured questionnaire was distributed to selected support networks comprising of approximately 185 participants altogether. One hundred and sixty two participants in the support networks selected, responded by completing the questionnaire. Various techniques were used to collect and analyse the data. The study found that there are key attributes that are necessary for a support network to achieve its purpose. It further found that the key attributes of a traditional family support network can exist in a corporate support network by allowing people to come together to discuss issues of common interest and challenges facing them as members of organisations.

Due to their potential horizontal structure, cooperatives are seen as organizations which increase the sense of equality among its members. Thus, in times of economic recession, where unemployment rises and labor conditions become tougher, cooperative organizations are seen as alternative, bottom-up solutions. However, as hierarchical structures are predominant in nearly every type of organization, it is not clear to what extend an organization can use more egalitarian ways of working together. In order to examine whether a cooperative organization can be based on a horizontal foundation, this thesis draws attention to Greece and particularly, the worker cooperative of Vio.Me. More precisely, after archival and fieldwork research at Vio.Me’s cooperative, and by focusing on Vio.Me’s organizational structure, its decision-making processes, its channels of communication and the market in which it operates, this thesis indicates that, Vio.Me’s cooperative has been able to eliminate to a great extent the hierarchical relations thereby promoting improved equality in the workplace and thus, with regards to the thesis delimitations its model seems be able to be replicated for other cooperatives.","2014-06-23","2022-10-06 03:46:42","2022-10-06 03:46:47","2022-10-06 03:46:42","","","","","","","Reducing Hierarchies for Improved Equality in the Workplace?","","","","","","","eng","","","","","gupea.ub.gu.se","","Accepted: 2014-06-23T09:14:30Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The School Description Inventory (SDI) was used to measure the educator's perception of the degree of bureaucratization. The PCI Form was used to measure the educator's self-perceived beliefs toward control of students along a humanistic-custodial continuum. Demographic Data sheets were administered to teachers (N = 297). The PCB Form was used to measure the student's view of teachers' control behavior along a humanistic-custodial continuum. This scale was administered to students in 20 randomly selected Midwestern secondary high schools. The results of the study indicated that there is a direct relationship between a greater Hierarchy of Authority, emphasis on Rules and Regulations, level of Impersonality, degree of emphasizing Technical Competence, degree of Subject Matter Specialization, level of Centralization of Control, overall bureaucratization, and a custodial Pupil Control Ideology variables were as follows:.67 (p $<$.01);.81 (p $<$.01);.61 (p $<$.01);.67 (p $<$.01);.34 (p $<$.01);.78 (p $<$.01); and.84 (p $<$.01) respectively. The correlation values for the custodial Pupil Control Behavior variable were as follows:.56 (p $<$.01);.65 (p $<$.01);.52 (p $<$.01);.58 (p $<$.01);.30 (p $<$.01);.63 (p $<$.01); and.69 (p $<$.01) respectively. Taken together, the finding of this investigation indicate that public school teachers and their students are more custodial in their beliefs toward pupil control in more bureaucratic schools and more humanistic in their beliefs toward pupil control in less bureaucratic schools. A custodial ideology stresses maintenance of order, dominance, authoritarianism, impersonality, downward communication, subordination, conformity, mistrust, and punitive sanctions. A humanistic ideology stresses acceptance, trust, understanding, flexibility, self-discipline, individuality, and a democratic atmosphere with open channels of two-way communication. The relationship of bureaucratization to Pupil Control Ideology and Pupil Control Behavior documented in this study implies that schools should be moving away from bureaucratic organizations and toward cooperative forms of organization that can better accommodate humanistic educators and students.","","2022-10-06 03:48:35","2022-10-06 03:48:35","2022-10-06 03:48:35","","184","","","","","","","","","","Loyola University Chicago","United States -- Illinois","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780591711974","","","","","Education; high school students; pupil control; teachers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Marital adjustment and the concept of a child being triangulated between their two parents (enmeshed with one parent and disengaged from the other) were examined in relation to both childhood depression and academic underachievement. This study used a matched set of children and adolescents (age 11.0 through 15.11) and their two biological parents. One set of families (N = 47) consisted of children who were randomly selected from a clinic which provides treatment for academic underachievement. The other (N = 48) was a matched group of non-clinic normally-achieving children randomly selected from a Philadelphia suburban public middle school. Children from both groups were administered the Child's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Parent-Adolescent Communication Inventory (PACI-A). The subscales of the PACI-A (Open and Problematic) were used to test the concept of triangulation as defined and operationalized for this study. Both parents of the children from both groups completed the Short Marital Adjustment Test (SMAT). A series of analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to test for differences between and within the two groups. The results of this study suggest that there is a relationship between (1) academic underachievement and childhood depression; (2) academic underachievement, childhood depression and marital adjustment; (3) childhood depression, marital adjustment and triangulation of a symptomatic child. Academic underachievement was not found to be related to the concept of triangulation. The results of this study suggest that clinically depressed children, when compared to non-depressed children, are significantly more likely to be academically underachieving, be in a triangulated relationship with their parents, and have parents who report lower marital adjustment scores.","","2022-10-06 03:48:44","2022-10-06 03:48:44","2022-10-06 03:48:44","","171","","","","","The triangulated, symptomatic child","","","","","University of Pennsylvania","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","D.S.W.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798535582498","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology; depression; Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"9MVHRF29","thesis","","Margerum, Richard Dale","Examining the practice of integrated environmental management: Towards a conceptual model","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304250831/abstract/7287D662FFB40B5PQ/1","Integrated environmental management (IEM) is one of several terms in the environmental management literature that refers to a more holistic and integrated approach to managing environmental systems. Several fields use closely related terms--such as, integrated resources management, ecosystem management, and watershed management--all of which emphasize the transition from single-issue, single-agency approaches to multi-objective, system-wide approaches. The literature in these fields describes four substantive elements of integrated management: holistic, interconnective, goal-oriented and strategic. However, research to date has not offered a procedural model for IEM practice--suggesting only that coordination is a key component. The author uses an exploratory methodology to investigate eight case studies that met the substantive criteria of IEM. He identifies the components of an operational model and analyzes the planning and implementation stages of IEM. Because case study findings suggest that interaction was the key procedural component, the author investigated this aspect in-depth by adapting selected approaches to analyzing institutions. An institutional rules methodology provides a more rigorous and explicit approach to analyzing interaction, revealing insights into IEM practice and contributing a framework for analyzing interaction. The author identifies sixteen elements critical to the success of IEM; these elements collectively comprise a model of IEM practice. Critical elements include: the need for an organization capable of initiating and leading an effort to transform the management approach: the need for collaborative decision making during the planning process; the need to resolve conflicts among stakeholders; the need to involve the public; and the need for ""mutuality"" during implementation. Critical elements based on the institutional analysis methodology include: the need for an expanded institutional scope; the need to explicitly identify position holders in the institution; the need for limitations on autonomous decision making; and the need for explicit rules or norms for sharing information and making joint decisions. The model leads to several hypotheses for future research.","","2022-10-06 03:48:51","2022-10-06 03:48:51","2022-10-06 03:48:51","","305","","","","","Examining the practice of integrated environmental management","","","","","The University of Wisconsin - Madison","United States -- Wisconsin","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798208772638","","","","","sustainable development; Social sciences; Health and environmental sciences; Biological sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More recently, former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called for more understanding of dissent, but how dissent occurs is little understood in civil-military contexts. Organizational theorists are convinced dissent is ultimately healthy to all organizations, even civil-military ones. This study asked how dissent occurs within the civil-military relationship in positive, historical dissent events. A historiographical approach examined the chronology of dissent over desegregation of the U.S. Army before, during, and after President Truman issued Executive Order 9981, declaring “equality of treatment and equal opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion, or national origin” (13 Fed. Reg. 4313, July 28, 1948). The U.S. Army continued to dissent 2 years after the order came out. Conflict theory holds conflict as influential in dissent (Coser, 1957). Hierarchy and power play important roles in dissent (Kassing, 1997, 1998, 2012, 2013). Lamb’s (2013) historical discourse analysis offered a high-level dissent analysis in civil-military relations from 1945 to 1950. The study found that dissent occurred because of conflict, yet conflict also resulted from dissent. Previous dissent research has concerned itself with dissent up the hierarchy, but this research discovered that upward, lateral, and outward dissent occurred simultaneously. Power patterns emerged as groups in dissent displayed, battled for, and consolidated power before a weakened, final engagement marked the terminus of open dissent. Dissent reverberated outward from political and military groups in conflict, embroiling the social group. This study contributes to dissent theory, demonstrating the influence of hierarchies and power and supporting theoretical research that dissent happens over time. Previous dissent research focused on why dissent happens. This study provided additional insight into how dissent happens, advancing civil-military theory and concluding that civil-military relations are composed of not just civilian and military authority, but a tripartite genus of political, military, and social groups. The research supports dissent as healthy to U.S. civil-military relations.","2018","2022-10-06 03:49:28","2022-10-06 03:49:28","2022-10-06 03:49:28","","305","","","","","Dissention in the Ranks—Dissent within U.S. Civil-Military Relations During the Truman Administration","","","","","The George Washington University","United States -- District of Columbia","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780355420739 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","","","","","Power; Social sciences; Hierarchy; Conflict; Civil-military relations; Desegregation; Dissent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Literature (Mason & Rubenstein, 1989:39; Horton & Hunt, 1984:15) reveals that family therapy can also work well in the Third World ""if it is not for the blacks but also of the blacks"". Innovations are most readily accepted when they fit within the existing culture. These statements suggest that family therapy needs to be practised within the context of a particular culture. The purpose of this study is to establish and present guidelines for the implementation of family therapy in social work in Tsonga families. The study was conducted among social workers in the employment of welfare agencies that have been using family therapy with Tsonga people for three years or more in the Lowveld and Northern regions of the Northern Province. Twelve social workers were selected but only eight participated in the study. Semi-structured interview was used to gather data for the research. The research finding reveals that cultural consideration is essential when working with Tsonga people because they are still adherent to cultural practices. The findings provided a basis through which guidelines for use by social workers in family therapy with Tsonga people were established. The study presents the guidelines as recommendations to be considered when practising family therapy within Tsonga culture. The researcher is of the opinion that if practised properly, the guidelines can be a valuable asset for enhancing cultural sensitivity in family therapy and can greatly improve its efficiency and effectiveness with families of various cultural backgrounds. Alternate abstract: Gesinsterapie word op die terapeutiese metodes van die Eerstewereld gebaseer en word doeltreffend deur terapeute in daardie konteks gebruik. Volgens Iiteratuur (Mason & Rubenstein, 1989:39; Horton & Hunt, 1984:15) kan gesinsterapie ook doeltreffend in die Derdewereld gebruik word, ""If it is not only for the blacks but also of the blacks"". Veranderinge word maklik aanvaar wanneer dit binne die bestaande kultuur inpas. Hierdie stellings impliseer dat gesinsterapie binne die konteks van 'n spesifieke kultuur beoefen moet word. Die doel van hierdie studie is om riglyne daar stel en ook leiding to gee oor die implementering van gesinsterapie in maatskaplike werk in Tsonga-gesinne. Die studie is gedoen onder maatskaplike werkers wat in diens is van welsynsorganisasies wat gesinsterapie vir ten minste drie jaar onder die Tsongas, in die Laeveld en Noordelike streke van die Noordelike Provinsie, toegepas het. Twaalf maatskaplike werkers is geselekteer, maar net agt het aan die studie deel geneem. Die data is deur middel van semi-gestruktureede onderhoude versamel. Die ondersoek het aan die lig gebring dat kulturele oorwegings onontbeerlik is wanneer iemand onder die Tsongas werk, aangesien hierdie mense aan hul kultuurgewoontes vashou. Die navorsingsbevinding verskaf 'n basis waardeur riglyne vir maatskaplike werkers in gesinsterapie onder die Tsongas gevestig kan word. Die studie stel riglyne daar wat oorweeg moet word wanneer gesinsterapie binne die Tsonga kultuur toegepas word. Die navorser is van mening dat wanneer hierdie riglyne korrek toegepas word, hulle baie waardevolle instrumente kan wees ter bevordering van kultuursensitiwiteit in gesinsterapie, asook ter verbetering van gesinsterapie se doeltreffendheid binne gesinne uit verskillende kulture.","","2022-10-06 03:49:51","2022-10-06 03:49:51","2022-10-06 03:49:51","","132","","","","","","","","","","University of Johannesburg (South Africa)","South Africa","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798744422745","","","","","Culture; Interviews; Qualitative research; Family structure; Information technology; System theory; Data analysis; Values; Children & youth; Data collection; Individual & family studies; Marriage; Research methodology; Social work; Social workers; Therapy; Families & family life; Grandparents; Objectives; Open systems; Parents & parenting; Therapists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parties-as-networks include interest groups, social movements, media, political consultants, and advocacy organizations, in additional to the usual suspects of elected officials, party officials, and citizen-activists.  This approach ameliorates several deficits of the traditional, tripartite view of parties in government, in elections, and as organizations.  The authors apply the parties-as-networks approach using data from surveys of delegates at the 2008 Democratic and Republican national conventions.  Analysis of delegates’ memberships in a wide variety of organizations demonstrates that Democrats have larger networks than do Republicans; Republican networks tend more toward hierarchy than do Democratic networks; and the content of Democratic networks is tilted toward labor and identity organizations, while Republican networks are more populated by civic, religious, and professional organizations.  The parties-as-networks view is a potentially revealing source of insight on the dynamic evolution of party coalitions.  Theoretically, approaching parties as networks deepens the understanding of how intermediary institutions matter to the functioning of democratic politics.","2009-09-06","2022-10-06 03:50:05","2022-10-06 03:50:05","2022-10-06 03:50:05","","","","","","","Networking the Parties","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","social network analysis; social movements; interest groups; Democratic Party; national party conventions; Parties-as-networks; party in elections; party in government; party organization; Republican Party","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1451174","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess the importance of a node in a directed network, various centrality measures based on different criteria have been proposed. However, calculating the centrality of a node is often difficult because of the overwhelming size of the network or because the information held about the network is incomplete. Thus, developing an approximation method for estimating centrality measures is needed. In this study, we focus on modular networks; many real-world networks are composed of modules, where connection is dense within a module and sparse across different modules. We show that ranking-type centrality measures, including the PageRank, can be efficiently estimated once the modular structure of a network is extracted. We develop an analytical method to evaluate the centrality of nodes by combining the local property (i.e. indegree and outdegree of nodes) and the global property (i.e. centrality of modules). The proposed method is corroborated by real data. Our results provide a linkage between the ranking-type centrality values of modules and those of individual nodes. They also reveal the hierarchical structure of networks in the sense of subordination (not nestedness) laid out by connectivity among modules of different relative importance. The present study raises a novel motive for identifying modules in networks.","2009-11","2022-10-06 03:50:20","2022-10-06 03:50:20","2022-10-06 03:50:20","113002","","11","11","","New J.

In schools however, historically marginalized populations remain significantly and disproportionately underrepresented within advanced academic environments. Research into the phenomenon of underrepresentation presents several limitations. First, a preponderance of the scholarship focuses exclusively on high school students, neglecting other grade bands. Secondly, a majority of the research narrowly examines statistical representations of underrepresented populations, in absence of other qualitative information. Third, a further gap exists in the scholarship around historically marginalized middle school students in advanced programs. This proposed dissertation seeks to understand the factors that attribute to underrepresentation among middle school students in predominantly white advanced environments. This qualitative phenomenological study seeks to document the experiences of historically marginalized middle school students participating in advanced programming and AVID, a teaching and learning program centered on academic and social/emotional support. Theories of Critical Race, adolescent racial and social identity development, and Relational Cultural Theory are evaluated to form a theoretical framework that examines the experiences of historically marginalized AVID students within predominantly white advanced programs. Qualitative methodologies involved interviews that sought to 1) privilege the experiences of students, 2) explore the complexities of adolescence and racial/ethnic identity development, 3) identify the extent to which the relational cultural framework (used within the AVID elective class) supports or fails to support historically marginalized students within advanced learning environments. Developing an understanding of prohibitive factors or positive assets in support of school achievement within the AVID program has the potential to inform practices and/or diminish barriers to student participation in advanced classes.","2021","2022-10-06 03:50:49","2022-10-06 03:50:49","2022-10-06 03:50:49","","163","","","","","Advanced Places - White Spaces","","","","","University of Pennsylvania","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798538112067 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","","","","","Minoritized populations; Social emotional identities; White spaces","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The conclusion of this research program is that hierarchical ordering principles primarily work to structure relations among states in the international system. This dissertation offers an alternative view of international hierarchy. More specifically, this project explores the implications that international hierarchy has for political developments within -- rather than between -- states. I first argue that international hierarchy is oriented around the securing of favorable leadership within other states. I find that ""dominant states"" can alter the willingness of groups within ""subordinate states"" to compete for domestic political power by shaping the value these groups place on holding office. This argument has three empirical implications. First, I show that by conditionally promising resources like foreign aid to groups within subordinate states, dominant states can bring new, friendly leaders to power, in effect ""purchasing"" regime change. Second, I find that dominant states are able to deter challenges to their preferred regimes within subordinate states by providing foreign aid and by threatening unfriendly groups with coercion. Finally, I show that the disappearance of hierarchy -- and its attendant regime security -- generate incentives for civil conflict.","2015-05","2022-10-06 03:51:35","2022-10-06 03:51:35","2022-10-06 03:51:35","","","","","","","Protection from themselves","","","","","","","en","","Thesis","","","repositories.lib.utexas.edu","","Accepted: 2015-10-09T17:53:50Z DOI: 10.15781/T2MK6S","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although this has greatly enhanced our understanding of international politics, we know less about what the implications of hierarchy are for domestic politics in subordinate states. Because of the varieties of domestic political control - including violence - employed by great powers, opening up the black box of subordinate state politics can yield new insights into the operations and limits of international hierarchy.

It argues that the apparent peace among democratic states that emerges in the aftermath of World War I is not caused by domestic institutional attributes normally associated with democracy. Instead, this peace is an artifact of historically specific great power settlements. These settlements shape subsequent aggregate patterns of military conflict by altering the organizational configuration of the system in three critical ways—by creating new states, by altering hierarchical orders, and by influencing regime type in states. These claims are defended with a series of tests that show first how the statistical relationship between democracy and peace has exhibited substantial variation across great power orders; second, that this statistical relationship breaks down with theoretically motivated research design changes; and third, that great powers foster peace and similar regime types within their hierarchical orders. In short, the relationship between democracy and peace is spurious. The international political order is still built and managed by great powers.","2015","2022-10-06 03:52:55","2022-10-06 03:52:55","2022-10-06 03:52:55","557-588","","3","69","","","Great Powers, Hierarchy, and Endogenous Regimes","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since Wittfogel (1957) proposed a correlation between irrigation and the development of pristine states, the relationships between social organization, political power, and coordinated subsistence strategies have been hotly debated. This research will examine the role of irrigation in the transition to early urban settlements in the Nepeña Valley, on the north-central coast of Peru. I especially focus on the nature of political structure and social organization, examining the validity of Wittfogelian hierarchical models as they pertain to irrigation systems and settlement pattern shifts that coincide with changing subsistence strategies. In order to examine shifts in patterns of subsistence and settlement, potential canals are identified for each time period based on site location as well as degrees of social complexity and political authority as indicated by architectural analysis. Influence areas for each major site are also determined from surface data. From architectural density, population estimates are calculated, which allows for an estimation of the areal extent necessary to support the settlements and validity of previously established carrying capacity. Ultimately, it becomes apparent that irrigation strategies were present as early as the Initial Period (1800-900 BC) and firmly established by the Early Horizon (900-200 BC). Irrigation and spatial evidence suggests gradual, in-situ, intensification of irrigation systems, which highlights the intimate relationships between subsistence strategy and social complexity. This development reflects political organization characterized by heterarchy and brings into question dogmatic hierarchical models of social organization.","2013","2022-10-06 03:53:15","2022-10-06 03:53:15","2022-10-06 03:53:15","","100","","","","","","","","","","Louisiana State University and Agricultural & Mechanical College","United States -- Louisiana","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798819324172","","","","","Adaptation; Climate change; Culture; Geography; Environmental management; Management; Sociology; Agriculture; Irrigation; Demography; Political power; Environmental impact; Valleys; Political science; Society; Agricultural production; Canals; Coasts; Gravity; Interest groups; Labor force; Landslides & mudslides; Latin American studies; Mountains; Physical geography; Regional studies; Regions; Rivers; Topography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Applying a Fit Perspective to College Presidential Tenure.","","","","","http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/133176","Over the last century, the tenure of college president’s has been continually decreasing. While some scholars have approached this issue by studying individual characteristics of presidents and others have studied the characteristics of the institution, few have focused on the interaction of the individual and institution together, or “fit.” This study uses the person-organization framework to enhance understanding of the effect of fit between presidents and their associated institution on turnover to benefit both researchers and practitioners.  For researchers, this study presents a new way to conceptualize the turnover challenge in higher education.  For practitioners this study offers foundational scaffolding for defining and utilizing fit to select and retain presidents.   Through the use of an innovative conceptual framework this study uses two methodological approaches to identify the relationship between fit and presidential transition. First, through a cross sectional analyses of college presidents from 2001, 2006, and 2011, this study utilized negative binomial regression to identify relationships between select presidential/organizational characteristics, fit constructs, and presidential tenure. The results reveal a number of statistically significant relationships including age-at-appointment, sex, and career pathway.  High supplementary fit and complementary fit between presidential attributes and organizational attributes were associated with longer presidential tenure.  The second application utilized event history analysis to measure how presidential/organizational characteristics and fit constructs were associated with presidential departure to another presidency.  In this analysis, age-at-appointment, career pathway, proportion of revenues that were garnered by tuition, and low supplementary/complementary fit had meaningful relationships with the likelihood of presidential departure.  These two analyses provide evidence that fit matters when predicting presidential tenure.   This study highlights the importance of both presidents and institutions seeking to maximize two kinds of fit in order to ensure that incoming presidents have the opportunity to be successful and that the institution will benefit from continuity in both leadership and vision. The successful tenure of presidents can be markedly enhanced if both complementary and supplementary fit is improved. This study concludes by discussing practical applications regarding selecting and evaluating presidents as well as pointing out some potential directions for future research.","2016","2022-10-06 03:53:27","2022-10-06 03:53:27","2022-10-06 03:53:27","","","","","","","Leaving So Soon?","","","","","","","en_US","","Thesis","","","deepblue.lib.umich.edu","","Accepted: 2016-09-13T13:49:38Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The causes of disruptive behavior are complex but disruptive behavior can occur when staff members turn their anger and frustration toward their coworkers. The consequences of disruptive behavior impede communication and erode teamwork which leads to avoidable medical errors, malpractice risk, and other compromises in quality care. In order to minimize the adverse effects of disruptive behavior, healthcare organizations need to develop zero tolerance policies, provide education to employees and patients, and implement strict standards to effectively deal with this issue. An increased understanding of the causes and consequences of disruptive behavior will help members of the healthcare team effectively deal with frustrations inherent to the high stress environment in which they work and help minimize displaced anger.

This function penalises the links violating the hierarchy in a way depending on the strength of the violation. To investigate the resolution of ranking hierarchies we introduce an ensemble of random graphs, the Ranked Stochastic Block Model. We find that agony may fail to identify hierarchies when the structure is not strong enough and the size of the classes is small with respect to the whole network.

Data collection occurred from 1993-98 and included an administrative database, a mailed survey of teachers, interviews with headteachers, and case studies of three schools. Results are presented according to: how social and academic polarization between schools changed since 1992 and why; whether improved academic performance at the school level was more difficult to achieve for  schools with more socially disadvantaged students; whether marketization impacted schools with more socially disadvantaged students differently; and how student communities affected schools' improvement strategies and competitive responses. Results indicate that the proportion of socially disadvantaged students in a school community has had a negative impact on attracting resources and improving achievement, and the two factors are interrelated.

Less attention has been paid to instances in which other persons, beyond the individual who caused the event, are also held responsible. Such instances, which can be referred to as instances of collective responsibility, were the focus of the research presented in this dissertation. Collective responsibility was hypothesized to be based in the perception that members of a group are interpersonally interdependent with the person who committed a wrong-doing. The perception of interdependence is proposed to influence judgments of collective responsibility by influencing two causal inferences that lay people may make regarding negative events. These inferences are that the other members of the group may have indirectly facilitated or encouraged the negative action (referred to as an inference of commission) or that they failed to prevent the negative action (referred to as an inference of omission). Thus, it was proposed that inferences of commission and omission mediate the relationship between perceptions of interdependence and judgments of collective responsibility. Four studies tested this basic model, and several extensions of it, using a variety of empirical strategies. Study 1 was a large-scale correlational study in which participants judged the degree of interdependence, collective responsibility, and the applicability of inferences of commission and omission for a sample of thirty groups. Study 2 was an experimental study in which perceptions of interdependence were manipulated and the effects of this manipulation on inferences of commission and omission and judgments of collective responsibility were examined. Studies 3 and 4 examined the ability of the model to make sense of people's reactions to a real-world event—the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. The results of all four studies supported the proposed model and suggest that perceivers do have well developed ideas of when and why collective responsibility should be assigned. The model developed in this dissertation provides an initial framework for understanding how these judgments are made.","","2022-10-06 04:00:49","2022-10-06 04:00:49","2022-10-06 04:00:49","","166","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Santa Barbara","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493126784","","","","","Psychology; Morality; Collective responsibility; Causal inference; Interdependence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a hierarchical community structure, the super node at a higher level represents a nested structure so that the relationship of subcommunities in a community can be observed. Most of the previous works focused on designing metaheuristics for detecting hierarchical community structures, which may be computationally efficient, but cannot always guarantee the community partition optimality. Hence, this paper proposes an integer linear programming model for detecting the hierarchical community structure in social networks, which takes into account the number of levels and the limit of community size of each level. Our experimental results show that our model can find a reasonable hierarchical community structure, where the interaction between communities at different levels can be comprehended more clearly.","2013-12","2022-10-06 04:01:05","2022-10-06 04:01:05","","1136-1140","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2157-362X","","","","","Social network; Mathematical programming; Linear programming; Upper bound; community detection; Mathematical model; Communities; Social network services; hierarchical community structure; integer programming; Periodic structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2013 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current research study investigated ASA by determining whether family functioning factors are related to different levels of severity of ASA. An exploratory cross-sectional study was undertaken to examine the relationships between ASA and a number of family functioning factors. The specific factors included: (1) family closeness, (2) family cohesion, (3) family adaptability, and (4) family hierarchy patterns. Two hundred and one male and female adolescents who had been using marijuana at least two times per month, or using any other illicit substance, and 54 non-substance abusing adolescents participated in the study. The study examined both observational and self-report measures (parents and adolescents) of family functioning. Results revealed no significant relationships between the family functioning factors and different levels of ASA. However, closeness and cohesion do differentiate adolescent drug abusers from non-abusers (DANA). Results also indicated that the observational and self-report measures are not related, suggesting they are actually measuring different constructs, and both contribute to predictions of DANA. Further, the different informants of the self-report measures differ only when asked about ideal family situations, although on questions about actual family dynamics, family members agree. In addition, both adolescent and parental reports of family functioning have unique abilities to predict DANA.","","2022-10-06 04:02:31","2022-10-06 04:02:31","2022-10-06 04:02:31","","156","","","","","","","","","","Temple University","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780591785951","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When the immigrants began to settle in the region in the early 1950s, members of a local lineage had already occupied the best land and monopolized all political positions. Indigenous social and religious institutions had existed for centuries. The immigrants on the margins of this established lineage's territory with only limited resources. In a subordinate position, the immigrants had to rely on the lineage's religious institutions and security apparatus. They could not compete with the indigenous people nor could they challenge their authority; their residences were granted by the tolerance of the lineage. Although the immigrants were in an impoverished environment, new opportunities were sometimes generated by factional conflicts within the lineage and by changes in the local and the world market. The rival factions in the lineage would pay the immigrants off when they needed votes in elections. New demands on vegetables, poultry, and pond-fish turned their once infertile land into a productive zone. Needs of shamanic ritual and curing services fostered the emergence of a shaman in the immigrant settlement. The immigrants were sensitive to the market, they adjusted their production to meet the changing market demands. They developed their own farming techniques and tried to manipulate their religious settings for supernatural support. The competitive nature of production contributed to the cellularization of immigrant households. In the political domain, the immigrants had their representatives in the local political arena, but effective leadership was almost absent. Neither the local leaders nor the religious institution created by the shaman could unite the immigrants into a collective whole. The immigrant community was maintained only by a series of short term cooperative efforts, resulting in a fluid society with limited social obligations. This thesis explores the social history of the community in comparative context, drawing on earlier studies of similar fluid systems in other societies.","","2022-10-06 04:02:46","2022-10-06 04:02:46","2022-10-06 04:02:46","","239","","","","","Becoming marginal","","","","","University of Pittsburgh","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798209485377","","","","","Social sciences; Hong Kong","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Formed under the 1916 National Defense Act, its primary function was and is to train high school youth military techniques and history, citizenship and discipline. The organization has recently seen its stature elevated and its reach widened once Congress lifted caps on its expansion in 2001. The Junior ROTC's proliferation has led to criticism from peace activists who denounce military training and tactics in schools and political leaders who claim the benefits are suspect. Conversely, the program has earned the praises of varied school and government officials. What becomes clear is that little consensus on the program has been reached. It is my contention that Junior ROTC's current popularity within the American educational system is multifaceted and cannot be simplistically embraced or summarily discounted by disparate analyses. One must understand the organization's historical roots to comprehend its current manifestation. Thus, three related questions have guided my research. First, what, if any, prerequisites existed relevant to Junior ROTC? Second, how does recruitment correspond to the purpose of Junior ROTC's inception and consequent growth? Third, has the program focused on the recruitment of working class and racial minorities over its ninety-year history? First, two dialectically related historical constructs—preparedness ideology and economic imperialism-expansionism—serve as prerequisites to Junior ROTC's inception and consequent growth. The antecedent relationships of military philosophy, education, training and drilling are explored in relation to these constructs. Second, the historical record points to a program designed primarily to recruit high school aged youth. Primary data in various forms aptly illustrate the point. Third, the combination of historical and recent demographic data confirm Junior ROTC's recruitment focus on working class and disadvantaged youth, primarily in urban centers, which provides the military a ready reserve of labor. Junior ROTC while an attractive program to ‘reach’ at-risk high school students is a quick-fix approach to the numerous structural and social barriers placed in front of our youth. Thus, attention is devoted in the last chapter to potential alternatives.","","2022-10-06 04:05:29","2022-10-06 04:05:29","2022-10-06 04:05:29","","234","","","","","","","","","","University of Cincinnati","United States -- Ohio","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780496572526","","","","","Education; Public schools; Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps; Military","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The death of Mao ushered in a new era of relative liberation and openness, which led to a welcomed explosion of information about many aspects of Chinese cities and resulted in a large number of urban studies of China. However, while these studies have presented an array of descriptive accounts of Chinese urbanization, there is still a lack of comprehensive and rigorous statistical analysis of the dynamic relationship between China's urban system and the process of regional development. This thesis is an attempt to fill this void. A central question about the Chinese urbanization process is whether it is different from that of the industrialized west and/or that of the developing countries in general. My findings suggest that China has had a different development path. If the pre-reform development pattern was characterized as both hierarchically and spatial diffused, the post-reform pattern can be characterized as ""concentrated (spatially) decentralization (hierarchically)"". The data show that while industrial growth in this study period was spatially concentrated near regional urban centers, it was nevertheless diffused among cities of various size categories rather than concentrated in a few large urban centers.","","2022-10-06 04:06:02","2022-10-06 04:06:02","2022-10-06 04:06:02","","196","","","","","","","","","","University of Illinois at Chicago","United States -- Illinois","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780591376340","","","","","Social sciences; regional development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, not all cities have participated equally in this expansion. My research analyzes previously undocumented changes in the geographic pattern of overseas cargo service markets at U.S. cities between 1980 and the mid-1990s. The study identifies industry groups that rely heavily on air cargo service to facilitate their export activities and examines their employment distributions among U.S. metropolitan regions as an indicator of demand for overseas air cargo service. Further, it classifies U.S. metropolitan regions based on the mismatches revealed between improvement or decline in overseas air cargo service supply and demand. Finally, brief case studies of the political, economic, and industry issues that influence service and employment at Portland, Oregon; St. Louis; Washington-Baltimore; and Minneapolis-St. Paul demonstrate how local factors may affect the position of each U.S. city within the urban hierarchy defined by overseas air cargo service market characteristics. As our economy has become broader and more geographically flexible, so also have the supply and demand forces shaping local international air cargo service markets. During the study period, more U.S. cities gained direct links to the overseas air cargo service network. Concurrently, employment in industries that produce air-eligible exports became more widely dispersed among a greater number of places. My study reveals that the hierarchy of U.S. metropolitan regions competing for service and employers shifted away from traditionally dominant cities over this period. It demonstrates where actual service and employment have grown or declined, but more importantly identifies cities whose competitive position relative to other metropolitan regions has fallen or risen. Employment rank gain without commensurate improvement in service position reveals potential markets for new overseas air cargo service. Conversely, service position improvement without similar employment rank gain indicates potential opportunity for increased local airborne export production. The competition among U.S. cities for such service, and the export-industry jobs linked to it, is the underlying theme for the study.","","2022-10-06 04:06:15","2022-10-06 04:06:15","2022-10-06 04:06:15","","206","","","","","","","","","","University of Minnesota","United States -- Minnesota","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780591690088","","","","","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to them, Pakistani society continues to be highly hierarchical with stark class and caste-like boundaries, while in AJK these boundaries have become weaker and merely symbolic since the 1970s due to changes in four interconnected factors; namely, migration patterns, land ownership, access to education, and democratic politics. This created an unprecedented level of social mobility among and within biradaris, the caste-like kinship corporate entities that are the crucial social boundary in this region.

"KZ3HCEXX","thesis","2012","Loyens, Kim","Integrity secured. Understanding ethical decision making among street-level bureaucrats in the Belgian Labor Inspection and Federal Police.","","","","","https://lirias.kuleuven.be/1908389","This study focused on a fundamental issue in criminology: the question how front-line officers in the police and the labor inspection deal with their discretion, and particularly whether they use their discretion with integrity. The main interest of this study was to explain how organizational factors impact ethical decision making. The central research question was: How do organizational patterns impact the way in which street-level bureaucrats deal with specific moral dilemmas?This research question was addressed by means of an ethnographic, comparative study in different field organizations of the police and the labor inspection (i.e. 2 units of the Federal Police and 4 Directorates of the Inspection of Social Laws) in a medium-sized and a large judicial district within Belgium. The data collection methods were observation, informal conversation, interviewing and documentary analysis. These methods enabled the researcher to gain in-depth knowledge concerning the main components of the theoretical framework: behavioral style (i.e. dependent variable), organizational patterns (i.e. umbrella term for independent variables) and causal pathway (i.e. link between dependent and independent variables).This study hypothesized that organizational patterns impact the behavioral style through a specific causal pathway. The behavioral style refers to the way in which police officers and labor inspectors deal with moral dilemmas. Three moral dilemma types were analyzed: (1) decisions to start or stop an investigation, (2) decisions concerning applying investigative measures and procedural rules, and (3) decisions whether or not to report colleagues misbehavior. The behavioral style was operationalized by means of grid-group cultural theory (GGCT). This theory offers a fourfold typology with two dimensions: grid and group. Grid refers to the way in which individuals are bound by rules and stratification. Group refers to the extent in which individual choice is constrained by group choice (Thompson, Ellis, & Wildavsky, 1990; Douglas, 1978). This leads to four types of behavioral style. In hierarchy (i.e. high grid, high group), front-line officers aim at following rules and orders. In egalitarianism (i.e. low grid, high group), they base decisions on informal agreements within the group. In individualism (i.e. low grid, low group), decisions are made opportunistically by looking for ones best interest and maximizing efficiency. In fatalism (i.e. high grid, low group), front-line officers feel constrained by rules they do not endorse themselves. In the three dilemma types, street-level bureaucrats in this study could apply one of the four behavioral styles (or a combination).Organizational patterns as a general category refers to various relevant independent variables, including the relationship with judicial authorities, the managerial style of supervisors, group interaction, (perceived) discretion and autonomy. These factors were also operationalized by means of GGCT and could thus be hierarchical, egalitarian, individualistic or fatalistic (or a mix). GGCT hypothesizes that organizational patterns are associated with the behavioral style used by the members of that organization. Specifically, the hypothesis is that the relative importance of the four types in the organizational patterns will resemble the relative importance of the four types in the behavioral style. GGCT also emphasizes that the four types are present in all organizations, because they need each other to compensate for their own, built-in weaknesses and blind spots.GGCT, however, seems to be insufficient to explain the conditions and causal mechanisms under which behavior is influenced by one of the four types in specific situations. Therefore, the theoretical framework was complemented with causal mechanisms. These formed the central component of the causal pathway between the independent and the dependent variables. Inspiration was drawn from role strain theory that explains how people deal with conflicting expectations (Merton, 1957), and moral disengagement theory that explains why people engage in questionable behavior without remorse (Bandura, 1990a).In general, this study confirmed Lipsky (1980)s proposition that front-line officers do not only implement policy that is developed by higher authorities, but also produce policy by adapting the rules to particular situations and sometimes even bending them (Meyers & Vorsanger, 2003; Hupe & Hill, 2007). At the same time, the front-line officers in this study were to some extent also influenced by their organizational environment. The most striking findings concerning that organizational impact will be summarized below. These will be discussed for each behavioral style separately.As expected, judicial authorities regularly managed to influence street-level bureaucrats behavior. This logically derives from their role as leaders of the investigation. Street-level bureaucrats regularly applied a hierarchical behavioral style, in the sense that they respected the authority of the public prosecutor, the arbeidsauditeur (who is the counterpart of the public prosecutor at the labor court) and the examining magistrate. Also, supervisors formal authority was often respected. However, in the case of conflicting demands between various hierarchical actors, street-level bureaucrats not always chose to follow the highest actors demands. A case in point is the labor inspectors choice to neglect head offices orders in favor of supervisors orders. This was explained by the fact that supervisors orders were considered more nearby (and thus more important) than the head offices orders.Hierarchical orders were sometimes bypassed by individualistic strategies. Autonomy in the labor inspection sometimes led to inspectors misinterpreting head offices instructions, for example by broadening their discretionary powers or becoming blindedfor rules that limit discretion. Because supervisors often failed to inspect inspectors, these misperceptions were mostly not corrected. The discretion and autonomy police officers and labor inspectors enjoy also led to other types of individualistic behavior, such as breaking procedural rules to get results. This was often explained by the lack of oversight and managers emphasis on quantifiable results. Other findings, however, illustrated beneficial effects of such an individualistic managerial style, like encouraging the willingness to work hard(er).Sometimes street-level bureaucrats made decisions to start/stop an investigation or to use a specific investigative measure in an egalitarian way. In other words, they made these kinds of decisions as a group. This was more relevant in the police than in the labor inspection, simply because labor inspectors tend to work more individually than detectives. The latter sometimes made these group decisions without their supervisor knowing, which was enabled by the lack of oversight. Police managers, however, also sometimes deliberately chose to apply an egalitarian managerial style (i.e. decreasing grid to stimulate participatory decision making) to keep hard-working detectives motivated. In the police, the trust-based relationship with judicial authorities was particularly relevant to explain egalitarian decisions concerning investigative measures. When magistrates believed detectives had the same goals as they did, they tended to trust on detectives gut feeling. The egalitarian behavioral style was, however, also sometimes inspired by a compassionate attitude towards victims, especially when street-level bureaucrats were convinced that the social system failed to help these victims. Street-level bureaucrats sometimes also applied a fatalistic behavioral style in which they felt powerless to take action against crime or exploitation. Fatalism was mainly expressed in the relationship with victims or suspects. Police officers were often confronted with human exploitation victims who did not want to be saved, because they considered their exploitative living conditions to be more favorable than the conditions in which they lived before. Also, labor inspectors often complained about suspects being able to break rules without getting caught as a result of legal loopholes in social penal law or because they did not use all legal competences they had (e.g. right to search). As for the peer reporting dilemmas, this study partly confirmed classic theories that explain why staff members hold on to a silence code (e.g., blue code of silence in the police culture literature: Skolnick, 1975; Paoline, 2003). Street-level bureaucrats often decided not to report colleagues misbehavior because they wanted to preserve the relationship with them (i.e. egalitarian style of keeping silent) or because they knew that snitching would lead tocounter-snitching (i.e. individualistic style of keeping silent). Interestingly, this was not only relevant in the police (as the policeculture literature would predict), but also in the labor inspection. In addition, the study identified otherreasons that explain the decision to keep silent, such as I am too inexperienced to report misbehavior of more experienced colleagues (i.e. hierarchical style of keeping silent), This is not my responsibility (i.e. hierarchical style of keeping silent) and I do not want to interfere in my colleagues investigations (i.e. individualistic style of keeping silent). Interestingly, in more than half of the cases, the respondents decided not to keep silent. The study identified several reasons for reporting misbehavior, such as thinking the supervisor had the right to know (i.e. hierarchical reporting style), having higher seniority than the misbehaving colleague (i.e. hierarchical reporting style) and avoiding to get into trouble themselves (i.e. fatalistic reporting style). If the step to report the misbehavior to their supervisor was considered too risky, they sometimes decided to reprimand the colleague for his/her misbehavior. These findings illustrate that reasons to report or to keep silent are more complex than the whistleblowing literature suggests and that GGCT could be used to capture this complexity.This study aimed to enrich GGCT with middle range theories in the causal mechanism approach so explanations could be found for the impact of the four types of organizational patterns in specific situations. As an explorative qualitative study, the aim was not to generalize to a population, but to build a theory. The empirical findings should thus be tested in future research.","2012-05","2022-10-06 04:06:56","2022-10-06 04:06:59","2022-10-06 04:06:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","lirias.kuleuven.be","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"DGDWBWQN","thesis","","Lu, Can","Exploring Hidden Structures in Social Networks","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2006078482/abstract/7D86B6C772CE485CPQ/1","This thesis consists of three parts. The first part devotes to exploring hierarchy structures underlying directed social networks. Here, social hierarchy is a prevalent and universal feature in organizations while has not been extensively studied. The second part attempts to find the maximum clique in massive graphs efficiently. Cliques are widely used to represent communities in complex networks and have been studied for decades. However, finding the maximum clique in large graphs is challenging since the maximum clique problem is NP-hard. The third part focuses on identifying an induced complete bipartite subgraph K3,3, which is dense and triangle-free. Since triadic closure is ubiquitous in social networks,K3,3 is not supposed to exist frequently and will disappear over time. Here triadic closure refers to the property among three individuals, A, B and C, such that if there exist strong ties between A-B and A-C, then there must be a strong or weak tie between B-C. However, this intuition is challenged by empirical studies. First, social hierarchy (i.e., pyramid structure of societies) is a fundamental concept in sociology and social network analysis. The social hierarchy found in a social network can be utilized to improve the accuracy of link prediction, provide better query results, rank web pages, and study information flow and spread in complex networks. In this part, we model a social network as a directed graph G, and consider the social hierarchy as DAG (directed acyclic graph) of G, denoted as GD. By DAG, all the vertices in G can be partitioned into different levels, the vertices at the same level represent a disjoint group in the social hierarchy, and all the edges in the DAG follow one direction. The main issue we study is how to find the DAG GD of G. The approach we take is to find GD by removing all possible cycles from G such that G = U(G) ∪ G D where U(G) is a maximum Eulerian subgraph which contains all possible cycles. We give the reasons for doing so, investigate the properties of GD found, and discuss the applications. In addition, we develop a novel two-phase algorithm, called Greedy-&-Refine, which greedily computes an Eulerian subgraph and then refines this greedy solution to find the maximum Eulerian subgraph. We give a bound of the gap between the greedy solution and the optimal. Second, cliques refer to subgraphs in an undirected graph such that vertices in each subgraph are pairwise adjacent. The maximum clique problem, to find the clique with maximum number of vertices in a given graph, has been extensively studied by researchers. Besides it is an NP-hard problem, the maximum clique problem is known to have direct applications in various fields, such as community search in social networks and social media, team formation in expert networks, gene expression and motif discovery in bioinformatics and anomaly detection in complex networks, revealing the structure and function of networks. However, algorithms designed for the maximum clique problem are too expensive to deal with real-world networks, which are massive, sparse and associated with various characteristics. In this part, we devise a randomized algorithm for the maximum clique problem. Different from previous algorithms that search from each vertex one after another, our approach RMC, for the randomized maximum clique problem, employs a binary search while maintains a lower bound ùc and an upper bound ωc of ω(G). In each iteration, RMC attempts to find a ωt-clique where ωt = |(ωc + ωc)/2|. As finding ωt-cliques in each iteration is NP-complete, we extract a seed set S such that the problem of finding a ωt-clique in G is equivalent to finding a ωt-clique in S with probability ≥1 – n–c. We propose a novel iterative algorithm to determine the maximum clique by searching a k-clique in S starting from k = ωc + 1 until all seeds in S are pruned, when more iterations benefit marginally. As confirmed by the experiments, RMC finds the exact maximum cliques in all datasets tested.

"Y255RMIA","thesis","","Lubin, Valerie","Rights and Their Intrusion on Freedom in America","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2138206950/abstract/84BE133E3E174053PQ/1","Principles of rights and freedom are deeply engrained in the United States of America. From the Declaration of Independence, to the Constitution, and current customs, the country prides itself in being the land of the free, where rights exist for all. Through a combination of disciplined self-reliance and cooperation, the American people have achieved prosperity, positioning the country as an international leader, offering many opportunities to achieve success. However, our nation today faces serious wealth and opportunity inequalities that are defying our common view and exercise of rights along with freedom. Indeed, studies show that as wealth continues to increase for a few and remains concentrated in the top one percentile of the population, so does the number of low-income households, as income remains unchanged or insufficiently increases to help those families cover current living expenses. Research also reveals that financial status impacts access to education, as well as the level and quality of education, with more affluent families being most likely to complete higher education compared to their poor counterparts. This thesis argues that because our society is more oriented towards self-interest than common good, our current interpretation and exercise of freedom and rights are inadequate to surmount our income and opportunity crises. The thesis therefore explores different conceptions of freedom, the first being from the philosophical movement, existentialism which states that freedom is man’s ability to take responsibility for the meaning of his own life. Renown existentialist, Jean-Paul Sartre argues that freedom makes man responsible not just for himself, but for the world, and that in choosing what is good for him, he must choose what is good for all. Simone Weil presents a related view of freedom by emphasizing the existence of certain needs of the human soul such as needs for equality and hierarchy, obedience and liberty, truth and freedom of expression, privacy and social life, private and public properties. She also asserts that a free society is one where every measure is taken to satisfy those needs, seeing them as impersonal obligations to be met, distinct from and prior to rights, which are self-interested and not based on what is impersonal and sacred in every human being. Guided by Sartre and Weil’s views, the thesis ends by recommending that any solution to resolve our socioeconomic problems begin with a reassessment of our general understanding of rights and freedom, by divorcing the two in order to better identify and comprehend others’ limited freedom and how we contribute to it. As Sartre and Weil explain, understanding our freedom as a responsibility to ourselves and everyone else can help us think of our obligations towards one another, instead of primarily focusing on securing our personal rights and liberties.","","2022-10-06 04:08:17","2022-10-06 04:08:17","2022-10-06 04:08:17","","83","","","","","","","","","","Georgetown University","United States -- District of Columbia","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.L.S.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780438666603","","","","","Social sciences; Philosophy; religion and theology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"DN3AVV35","thesis","2010","Luo, Jianxi","Hierarchy in industry architecture : transaction strategy under technological constraints","","","","","https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/62759","Motivation -- Industrial firms survive, sustain and co-evolve by participating in the sector of innovation and production through industrial transactions with each other. However, it is difficult for specialized firms to be aware of and manage accordingly the kind of systemic constraints and opportunities induced by relevant but indirect transactions, as well as the technological and economic requirements of their value chains, which they cannot control or even sufficiently observe. The myopia may cause specialized firms to implement incorrect strategies, leave them vulnerable to system failures or ignorant of emerging opportunities. This implies a paradox: the simultaneous needs to specialize and to understand and manage the big picture of the eco-system. Goal -- Previous industry studies have focused on the question if a transaction with an external firm is needed rather than in-house production, and on empirical work from single industries or bilateral relationships between firms. Meanwhile, the firms' positions in the sectoral transactional network are also influential to the success and performance of firms. In this dissertation, I conduct transactional network analysis to explore how firms are organized in the sector of aggregated industries, in order to shed light on the set of previously ignored knowledge on industrial transactions, which is valuable to single firms in designing strategies and managing operations but is not available from firm- and industry-level analysis. Hierarchy in Industry Architecture -- At the sector level, existing theories often assumed hierarchical or non-hierarchical relationships among industrial firms, and quantitative evidence on variable degrees of hierarchy in industry sectors is lacking. This dissertation first identifies and defines the type of hierarchy relevant to industry studies -flow hierarchy, develops a network-based metric on the degree of hierarchy (one-way flow of transactions), and applies it to the transaction data from two industrial sectors in Japan. The empirical results show that the electronics sector exhibits a significantly lower degree of hierarchy than the automotive sector due to the presence of many transaction cycles. It shows that the simplistic hierarchy hypothesis for production sectors does not always hold. Industrial Network Model and Transaction Specificity -- I further create a network simulation model with random networks to relate sector-level hierarchy degrees to firm-level behavioral variables, and infer transaction specificity, i.e. the extent to which a firm is captive to a niche of customers positioned closely in the industrial network hierarchy. The model builds on three basic rules on market structures, i.e. hierarchy, niche, and the mapping relationship between roles and positions. Transaction specificity provides a way to quantify the tendency of a firm to fix or institutionalize its role according to its relative network position, or where the transactions of a firm are oriented in the value chains, whereas traditional studies analyze whether a transaction versus in-house production is needed. The result shows that transaction specificity in the electronics sector is quantitatively much lower than that in the automotive sector. Interviews and Firm Boundary Strategies -- I further conducted interviews with nine firms in the two sectors and found that, with decision rationales related to product modularity, innovation dynamics and asset specificity, the major electronics firms take the permeable vertical boundary strategy and diversified horizontal boundary strategy, which decrease transaction specificity so that many transaction cycles emerge in the electronics sector. My analysis shows the permeability of a firm's vertical boundary, i.e. playing multiple value chain roles, is the necessary condition for transaction cycles to emerge. Meanwhile, these two strategies are not feasible in the automotive sector according to interviews. They are also not observed in the American electronics sector. My data show the American electronics firms tend to be vertically specialized in the value chains. Social-Technical Arguments -- Linking network analysis results, interview data, and the prior work on the physical limits to product modularity, I argue that higher power level of a sector's technologies leads to higher transaction specificity, and more hierarchical transaction lows across the sector. High power technologies constrain strategic transaction choices, while lower power technologies enable a larger option space of transaction strategies, for companies to explore and exploit. Implications -- For academics, the use of network analysis permits transaction cost analysis, or more general analysis of transaction-related decisions, to be extended from the boundary of a firm to the architecture of a sector comprising related industries. It gives us a bird's-eye view to observe firm-level transaction behaviors and create new knowledge on transaction specificity. In addition, the analysis of the physical properties of product technologies allows us to interpret the difference in transaction specificities and hierarchy degrees of different sectors, which economic and sociology theories cannot explain. For industry practitioners, this research suggests that firms' choices for industrial transactions are under some predictable constraints from product technologies. A better understanding of the linkages between industry architecture, firm transaction strategy, and product technology, in turn can guide companies to tailor transaction strategies to implicit technological constraints and to adequately explore strategic options made feasible by technologies.","2010","2022-10-06 16:11:52","2022-10-06 16:11:52","2022-10-06 16:11:52","","","","","","","Hierarchy in industry architecture","","","","","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","","eng","M.I.T. theses are protected by  copyright.

This is despite the fact that Chapter 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa accords this institution status under the new political dispensation. What seems to be the bone of contention is the role traditional leaders should play in the present context. The roles and functions of amakhosi have been in constant flux, being redefined by different stages of history, from colonialism to apartheid and once again in the democratic South Africa. As such, amakhosi remain part of the present governance system.  This study was guided by several aims which included but were not limited to: establish and articulate the roles and functions of amakhosi in post-apartheid South Africa and local governance, with a specific focus on amakhosi falling under Ingonyama Trust; evaluate the adequacy of resources allocated to amakhosi for achieving their directive; parallel legal requirements with work taking place at grassroots level; as well as compare and contrast the mandate of amakhosi against that of democratically elected councillors focusing particularly on those who fall under Ingonyama Trust. Empirical research using questionnaires and interviews was conducted in the Ugu District Municipality.  The findings revealed inter alia that the roles and functions of amakhosi have been in constant flux over a lengthy period of time. As such, amakhosi and their traditional leadership supporting structures have had to constantly evolve to pass the bar. Another finding was that amakhosi are still accorded status and relevance in society but need to be provided financial resources for them to be more effective. Lastly, the study revealed that at times amakhosi and elected councillors compete for supremacy. It is therefore recommended that further legislation is needed to ensure that these two leadership structures work in harmony to ensure community development.","2015","2022-10-06 16:16:55","2022-10-06 16:16:55","2022-10-06 16:16:55","","","","","","","The roles and functions of traditional leaders (Amakhosi) in the democratic South Africa with a specific focus on those falling under Ingonyama Trust","","","","","","","en_ZA","","Thesis","","","ukzn-dspace.ukzn.ac.za","","Accepted: 2016-07-28T06:34:25Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"43NFGRCN","thesis","","Lyon, Michael H.","An enquiry into the origins of british racism","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/301409339/abstract/2CCECF66D944418APQ/1","Race is defined in terms of hegemonic ruling principles by means of an analytic contrast with caste and feudal hierarchy. Hierarchical, hieratic and, hegemonic colonial empire are compared in the Americas. The first two (Portuguese and Spanish) types of rule are shown to converge historically and to become racially attenuated. Both diverge increasingly from British hegemonic rule which is identified as raciogenic and potentially rank-disjunctive. The hegemonic conditions of race formation and ranking are, however, identified as post-colonial and are shown to derive from crises in capitalist-democracy. Intensifying crisis-successions are examined in the Deep South and South Africa. In the First Racist formation race precedes racism, but in the Second Racist formation, it is argued, race succeeds racism. Racial dynamics are explained by hegemonic developments, not by prior ruling ideas or rank formations. A structural theory of conflict transformation accounts for the critical construction of racist rule by means of ranking realignment, and is applied systematically .to the cases of Nazi Germany and post-imperial Britain. Contemporary metropolitan base-ranking is examined by comparing models of migrant labour control. British contraction is found to produce greatest contradiction in this respect. Brltish racist ranking is interpreted as an indigenous product of ruling crisis, not as an attribute of colonised migrant-settlers. The processes of minority formation and denigration are illustrated by an investigation into the position of British citizens of Asian extraction. The structural origins and transformation of British metropolitan crisis are explained substantively in terms of decolonisation, conflict accumulation and critical displacement. To investigate how racist resolution engenders ranking debasement, the social agents who mediate racification are examined. These are identified as the mainstream, parliamentary, not extremist forces in political democracy; and also the national press. In conclusion, an overall theory of hegemonic decline is formulated which synthesises previous case-findings and proposes a class-analysis of racial dynamics. The intensification of British metropolitan racism is finally assessed, both comparatively and immediately, as a continuing process","","2022-10-06 16:17:07","2022-10-06 16:17:07","2022-10-06 16:17:07","","1330","","","","","","","","","","University of Aberdeen (United Kingdom)","Scotland","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781073215478","","","","","Social sciences; (UMI)AAIU314820; Racism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Responsibility, family processes, and emotional competence in adolescents from divorced and remarried families","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304106523/abstract/2266D2A65B43444FPQ/1","Adolescents in divorced and remarried families are often asked to take on additional responsibilities for household chores and financial support of their family. Whether these responsibilities represent a burden or an opportunity to be a valued contributor to the family has been debated. The meaning of responsibilities may be determined by the family context. Family processes such as hierarchy and cohesion may mediate the relationship between family structure and adolescents' perception of their role in the family. Adolescents' perception of their role in the family (burdened or valued contributor) may determine emotional competence outcomes. Participants were from the sixth wave of the Michigan Study of Adolescent Life Transitions. This normative sample of predominately White 12th graders included students from married (N = 908), divorced single-mother (N = 133) and stepfather families (N = 90). Adolescents reported how many hours each week they spent completing household chores. Likert-scale items assessed perception of family role (burdened/valued contributor), level of cohesion and degree of hierarchy in family, and emotional competence (self-efficacy, self-esteem, depression). Results indicated that familial hierarchy, cohesion, and assignment of chores were related to whether adolescents perceived themselves as a valued contributor or burdened member. Family structure, chores and family processes were predictive of depression, and self-efficacy in boys. Contributor role was determined primarily by divorced family status and greater responsibility for chores. Burdened role was determined by divorced status and more chores, as well as greater hierarchy and lower cohesion. The low hierarchy which was more characteristic of divorced families partially protected adolescents from feeling more burdened by their chores or developing greater depressed mood. However, low cohesion in divorced and remarried families was related to slight increases in burden and depression. Adolescents in divorced families were most likely to provide direct financial support to their families. In divorced families, adolescents reported greater depression than adolescents who did not provide direct support. However, the responsibility of providing direct support was also linked to higher self-efficacy.","","2022-10-06 16:17:16","2022-10-06 16:17:16","2022-10-06 16:17:16","","136","","","","","Overburdened or valued contributors?","","","","","The Pennsylvania State University","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798635292891","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current approaches to pastoral care in the Korean American church encourage a deferring style of religious coping that maintains the status quo—the internalized status of marginality—without activating self agency for the fulfillment of one’s own selfhood within the communal life of religious communities. A communally grounded sense of self agency is described in terms of three aspects of Korean indigenous culture: (1) uri (we-ness), (2) jeong (communal empathic connection), and (3) han (the experience of suffering from interdependent injustice). A communal contextual narrative approach challenges the limitations of passive (deferring) ways of coping that disengage personal narratives from biblical narratives. This approach encourages a collaborative coping style, which emphasizes the partnership of human agency with divine agency in the context of the faith community. Asian (Korean) American feminist theologies, along with theologies of divine marginalization are used to describe a process of deconstructing dominant and destructive narratives and reconstructing alternative liberating narratives based on biblical stories about marginalization. In elaborating how to implement this model of pastoral care, this dissertation draws upon (1) narrative therapy approaches developed by White (1990, 2007) and other narrative therapists; (2) the “biblical narrative model” developed by Wimberly (1994, 2003, and 2008); and (3) the indigenous practice of han-pu-ri as a process of change. Four steps are outlined: (1) evoking sacredness, (2) naming and externalizing the problem, (3) re-authoring one’s story, and (4) re-membering and reconnecting with the community and God. Finally, this dissertation proposes a vision of the Korean American church as an Uri community that continues to weave the human narratives with biblical narratives, in which person, community, and God collaborate as partners for authoring life-giving stories that reflect the full potentiality of life. By reframing negative experiences of marginalization within the larger narratives of both the Uri community and biblical narratives of marginalization, this dissertation challenges Korean immigrants and their families to move from social marginality defined by oppressive narratives to authentic marginality defined by preferred narratives about God.","2009","2022-10-06 16:17:24","2022-10-06 16:17:24","2022-10-06 16:17:24","","265","","","","","Marginality and coping","","","","","The Iliff School of Theology and University of Denver","United States -- Colorado","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781109269857 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","","","","","Psychology; Philosophy; religion and theology; Coping; Christians; Korean-Americans; Marginality; Narrative therapy; Pastoral care; Pastoral care and counseling; Pastoral theology; Religious coping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I argue that existing literature on hierarchy, for all its diverse insights, misses what makes hierarchy unique in world politics. Hierarchy is not simply the presence of inequality or stratification among actors, but rather an authority relationship in which a dominant actor exercises some modicum of control over a subordinate one. This authority relationship, moreover, is dramatically different than ones found in domestic hierarchies. It is shaped less by written laws or formal procedures, than by subtle forms of manipulation and the development of informal practices. For this reason, hierarchy cannot simply be reduced the to the dynamics of anarchy, and must be viewed as a relational phenomenon. Ties between actors create positions that permit dominant actors to appropriate and orchestrate the sharing of authority with subordinate intermediaries. This article develops this relational network approach, highlighting how concepts such as access, brokerage, and yoking can illuminate the processes by which authority is enlisted and appropriated in world politics.","2018-01","2022-10-06 16:18:17","2022-10-06 16:18:17","2022-10-06 16:18:17","128-150","","1","44","","","Embedded authority","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","Hierarchy; Relationalism; Social Network Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the supply side, major powers vie to build, maintain and defend their leadership status. The potential leaders devise and follow strategies in pursuit. On the demand side, follower countries weigh the costs and benefits of following the leader candidates. They push and pull the potential leaders, and employ leverage tactics to settle on a regional leadership structure of choice. The dissertation focuses on the trade, monetary and institutional categories of leadership. In that light, the dissertation examines the empirical case of the U.S. leadership in Northeast Asia from 1950 to present. During the periods of the rise, maintenance and defense of the U.S. leadership, Japan, China, South Korea and Taiwan along with Southeast Asian nations demonstrate multifaceted compliance and resistance. More recently, Japan and China have contested America’s dominance in the region. Evidence shows that interactions between the suppliers and consumers of the leadership have shaped the hierarchical structure in Northeast Asia.","","2022-10-06 16:18:28","2022-10-06 16:18:28","2022-10-06 16:18:28","","147","","","","","Supply and Demand of Economic Hierarchy","","","","","University of Southern California","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798209709510","","","","","Social sciences; (UMI)AAI10801267; Hegemonic Stability Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Workfare workers complained of poor working conditions, arbitrary discipline, loss of benefits, and inequitable pay for the work they were doing. Municipal workers saw that jobs they had previously done being performed for a fraction of their pay. Community groups, welfare advocates, and unions therefore began to contest the dominant opposition between welfare and work by seeking to redefine elements of each. I examine the struggle over the meanings of workfare in New York City during the period of its greatest expansion and institutionalization. Were workfare workers welfare recipients, workers, neither, or both? Whether public debates treat workfare workers as workers, welfare recipients, or some combination of the two reverberates into decisions about how to organize them, which legal frameworks to apply to litigation brought on their behalf, and what rights and responsibilities their position entails. In addressing the answers that various groups formulated to this question, I ask: Why some actors and claims come to dominate a political debate? Why do positions of domination change? How do coalitions around claims form? What organizational and cultural dynamics lead to changed strategic positions for actors and their claims? How do larger socio-economic processes shape the settings within which debates over workfare unfolded? These questions lie at the intersection of cultural and political sociology. Drawing upon Gramsci's argument that the institutional differentiation of civil society disorganizes working-class coalitions by generating multiple, ambiguous principles by which claims can be made on state authorities, I show that workfare, through its effects upon many institutional arenas of urban life, similarly disorganizes its challengers. By extending Gramsci's argument with recent developments in social movement theory and cultural sociology, I propose that challenging groups' different capacities to set the terms of debate about workfare depend on their respective levels of narrative reach and constraint. I draw on measurements from social network analysis to understand the configuration of political-interpretive coalitions and to map positions in the field.

In the world where competitiveness increases in different business sectors and  natural resources decrease, mastering environmental management is a competitive  advantage. Environmental Management Systems (EMS) are a tool for focusing on  environmental issues as part of corporate responsibility making it part of the business  operations and daily routines. In this research the focus is on WWF’s Green Office EMS,  which some authors considers a “simplified” and WWF itself as a “practical” EMS.  The aim of the research was to find the main barriers and benefits of utilizing the  WWF’s Green Office EMS in its rather new market area, Vietnam. The research was  qualitative and the data of the case was collected via semi-structured interviews with 12  relevant Green Office EMS organizations in Vietnam, and also some key persons from  WWF were interviewed.  The research turned out to be very interesting and useful yet challenging, because  this field of business had very little if any former research in the research topic. The  research task was fulfilled by answering the research question and mapping out the  main barriers and benefits from utilizing the WWF’s Green Office EMS in Vietnam.  Also, some ideas to improve the EMS work in Vietnam were able to give.  The research shows that there are clear benefits from utilizing the WWF’s Green  Office EMS and the main benefits can be mentioned as motivating staff for  environmental actions in their daily work, as well as clear financial and material  savings. Regarding financial issues one of the main barriers seemed to be quite hard  economic situation in Asia, leading to costs of the EMS can form a barrier for the  utilization. Also WWF’s Green Office EMS is rather new in Vietnam which forms a  barrier to its wider utilization because it is not well-known EMS. More EMS promotion  and localization is needed to make the EMS utilization more beneficial.","2014","2022-10-06 16:36:55","2022-10-06 16:37:02","2022-10-06 16:36:55","","","","","","","Utilizing environmental management system in a new market area","","","","","","","eng","Julkaisu on tekijänoikeussäännösten alainen.

It is argued that, while conflicting negotiation styles create interactional difficulties between the Chinese and the northern Europeans, the impact of the interactional difficulties on the processes and outcomes of negotiations is critically dependent on the pre‐existing level of social capital among the negotiators. Social capital has three major components, namely cognitive, relational, and structural. The cognitive dimension highlights the level of shared understanding among the actors; the relational dimension focuses on the affective bonding among the actors; while the structural dimension highlights the nature of interconnectedness among the actors. This is an exploratory study conducted through in‐depth interviews with 24 northern Europeans and 15 Chinese managers, who have been negotiating with each other for several years. We highlight the linkages between the different dimensions of social capital and negotiation processes and outcomes, and conclude with implications for research and practice.","2003-01-01","2022-10-06 16:38:07","2022-10-06 16:38:07","2022-10-06 16:38:07","262-285","","3","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","Publisher: MCB UP Ltd","","","","","China; Interaction; Negotiating; International business; National cultures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bush's rhetoric of the War on Terror in Iraq. Contrary to the standard Aristotelian perspective of catharsis as the ""purging of pity and fear"" that brings relief and resolution to an audience, I turn to Kenneth Burke's claim that catharsis is tied to the scapegoating process and argue that catharsis is the purging and projection of one's trauma to a victim who serves as the sacrificial vessel for one's pain. I thus redefine catharsis as the purging of trauma that plays a key role in catharsis and leads to the victimage and scapegoating of the Other in language and public life. To explore how rhetorical catharsis functions in language use, I analyze the concept of a rhetorical catharsis through literature, presidential rhetoric, and print media and show how catharsis operates in the rhetoric of war, particularly that of President Bush's war on terror in Iraq. In addition to Kenneth Burke, I draw on scholars such as Rene Girard, Deborah Willis, Terry Eagleton, Robert Ivie, Allen Carter, Robert McChesney, and Bartholomew Sparrow, among many others. I argue that communities experiencing tragedy use language to name people and entire nations as the scapegoat for their ills. By understanding how language makes possible the victimage and scapegoating of vasts groups of people and even entire nations in times of national trauma, I offer ways of speaking about trauma that may help redirect the violent impulse of catharsis.","","2022-10-06 16:41:45","2022-10-06 16:41:45","2022-10-06 16:41:45","","173","","","","","Oedipus, runaway planes, and the violence of the scapegoat","","","","","The University of Arizona","United States -- Arizona","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780549136637","","","","","Social sciences; Language; literature and linguistics; Rhetoric; Bush; Catharsis; George W.; Scapegoat; Tragedy; Trauma; War on Terror","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many of Weber's examples of status refer to the United States, which Weber held to be the epitome of capitalist development. Weber hints at a second form of status, one generated by capitalism, which might reconcile this contradiction, and later theorists emphasize the continuing importance of status hierarchies. This article argues that such theories have missed one of the most important forms of contemporary status: celebrity. Celebrity is an omnipresent feature of contemporary society, blazing lasting impressions in the memories of all who cross its path. In keeping with Weber's conception of status, celebrity has come to dominate status “honor,” generate enormous economic benefits, and lay claim to certain legal privileges. Compared with other types of status, however, celebrity is status on speed. It confers honor in days, not generations; it decays over time, rather than accumulating; and it demands a constant supply of new recruits, rather than erecting barriers to entry.","2007","2022-10-06 16:48:47","2022-10-06 16:48:47","2022-10-06 16:48:47","347-367","","4","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9558.2007.00313.x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"JEK4PUCH","thesis","2020","Kwan, S.","Sun Yat-sen on China's place in international society","","","","","https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ed4b7cac-ad90-489c-ae54-ef38b4cc6f2f","<p>This thesis argues that Sun Yat-sen's intellectual engagement with China’s entry into international society should be seen through the prism of tianxia wei gong (all-under- heaven is shared by all), the crown jewel in his ideas on international relations. While the literature on the expansion of international society essentially frames China as a passive recipient of the standard of civilization, Sun’s conceptualization of tianxia shows an active in-depth engagement with worldviews emanating from aspiring entrant nations which have hitherto been neglected. His conceptualization of tianxia rests on his belief in the possibility of equality and justice between nations, including those yet to attain full membership in international society, anchored by a moral hierarchy centered around wangdao and self-rectification. The analysis of Sun’s tianxia presented here suggests that standards of civilization are far more multi-dimensional and nuanced than the existing literature portrays. In essence, the standard of civilization should not be seen merely as a one-dimensional checklist of objective and discrete items to be checked off one by one. Sun’s ideas on tianxia and international relations suggest that there is more agency on the part of new entrants than commonly assumed. However, Sun’s privileging of the moral over the political dimension of self-rectification, while being the defining characteristic of his ideas, is also its key weakness, because Sun never effectively addresses the issue of what happens in the event that countries start prioritizing their immediate political or economic interests over morality. Finally, it is open to question whether nations not rooted in Confucian culture or familiar with the concept of wangdao could ever self-rectify and center themselves in Sun’s tianxia.</p>","2020","2022-10-06 16:53:52","2022-10-06 16:53:52","2022-10-06 16:53:52","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oxford","","English","","http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","","","ora.ox.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"DDL4LMI5","thesis","","Kwon, Yong Soo","The relationship of HRM practices, trust, and justice with organizational commitment during organizational changes in the Korean public sector: An application of the psychological contract model","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304755762/abstract/E179CFBE0B81411DPQ/1","The study of organizational commitment has paid little attention to the dynamic process of change in organizational commitment within the context of organizational changes, such as restructuring and downsizing, which are prevalent today and have a critical effect on the employee-organization relationship. The purpose of the present study was to explore the changing nature of organizational commitment within the context of organizational change. Incorporating the psychological contract model, this study examined the causal relationships among employees' perceptions of HRM practices, trust, justice, the breach of the psychological contract, and the violation of the psychological contract in influencing their changes in organizational commitment during organizational changes. The data for this study were collected from 437 Korean public employees, who work in one of six central government ministries. The analysis of data was conducted using LISREL to test a structural equation model composed of causal paths among antecedent variables that influence organizational commitment as conceptualized by Meyer and Allen's three dimensional construct. The contextual assumption that Korean public employees have experienced organizational change was affirmed by both government statistics and employees' perceptions. As results of the analysis, all antecedent variables used in this study were found to have direct or/and indirect effects on affective and normative commitments. Results showed that all HRM practices have direct effects on the perceived breach of the psychological contract, and in turn the perceived breach affects the perceived violation of the psychological contract, which affects affective commitment. Results showed that participation in decision making has direct effect on trust and that trust affects affective and normative commitments. Results also showed that HRM practices, including compensation, training, career development and promotion, and participation in decision making, have direct effects on employees' perception of justice, which affects directly normative commitment and indirectly affective commitment via the perceived violation of the psychological contract. Some HRM practices, such as compensation, training, and career development and promotion, were found to have direct effects, as well as indirect effects, on affective commitment or/and normative commitment. However, no hypothesized antecedent was found to have a significant effect on continuance commitment. This study stimulates researchers to understand organizational commitment in a dynamic perspective. Future research needs to validate findings of this study and extend knowledge on the dynamic psychological process of organizational commitment by examining various organizational conditions.","","2022-10-06 16:54:01","2022-10-06 16:54:01","2022-10-06 16:54:01","","166","","","","","The relationship of HRM practices, trust, and justice with organizational commitment during organizational changes in the Korean public sector","","","","","State University of New York at Albany","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493051826","","","","","Social sciences; Trust; Justice; Human resource management; Korean; Organizational commitment; Psychological contract; Public sector","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Study 1 examined the perceived likelihood and effectiveness of hierarchy negotiation tactics performed by men and women in different contexts. Undergraduates (n = 227) judged how likely and how effective each of 79 acts (representing 26 tactics) would be in negotiating social, occupational, academic, or athletic hierarchies. Different patterns of likelihood and effectiveness emerged for each of the contexts. Tests for sex differences revealed that women were seen as more likely to use Social Display/Networking tactics more than men. Men were perceived to use Deception/Manipulation and Athletic tactics more than women. The results were used to evaluate evolutionary expectations of context and sex effects, and to interpret previous research on related topics such as power, social influence, and manipulation. Study 2 examined the self-reported likelihood of respondents performing the 26 tactics to negotiate social and occupational hierarchies. Respondents (n = 92) of mixed ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, education, occupations, and income evaluated their likelihood of performing the 79 acts (comprising the 26 tactics) of hierarchy negotiation in each of a social and an occupational setting. Advancing Professionally, Ingratiating Self with Superiors, Aggressing, Socializing Selectively, and Knowledge/Industriousness tactics were reported to be more likely in occupational contexts than in social contexts. Attracting the Opposite Sex, Social Participation, and Using Relatives were reported to be more likely in social contexts than in occupational contexts. Most of the Deception/Manipulation, Social Display/Networking, and Autonomy tactics were reported to be equally likely in social and occupational contexts. Men reported being more likely to Display Athleticism, Aggress, Ingratiate Self with Superiors, Assume Leadership, or to use Deception/Manipulation tactics than women. Women reported being more likely than men to Enhance their Appearance or to Cultivate Friendships to gel ahead. There were no sex differences in the reported likelihoods of men and women using Social Display/Networking, Knowledge/Industriousness, or Autonomy tactics. Results were discussed in light of evolutionary theory and related research on sex differences in dominance, aggression, attractiveness, and deceptive self-promotion.","","2022-10-06 16:54:07","2022-10-06 16:54:07","2022-10-06 16:54:07","","137","","","","","","","","","","University of Michigan","United States -- Michigan","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798207344546","","","","","Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To minimize the effects of these operational costs, leaders must morally asses their forces and strive to implement programs to minimize future ethical failures while developing systems that promote learning from the failures that do occur. Fundamental development and implementation of ethics is crucial to minimize the risk of future ethical failures. While the artifacts of the Army Ethic fall under the purview of Strategic leaders, development of ethics within operational units and the follow-on implementation of those ethics is the purview of the operational commander. When ethical failures occur, operational units must have the necessary systems in place to address those failures and promote learning throughout the unit. Failure to implement the necessary systems increases the risk of operational costs of future ethical failures.","","2022-10-06 16:55:39","2022-10-06 16:55:39","2022-10-06 16:55:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","apps.dtic.mil","","Section: Technical Reports","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The thesis therefore sets out a way of understanding scalar genesis or individuation. Drawing on the work of Gilles Deleuze, Gilbert Simondon, Manuel Delanda and Michel Foucault it attends to this scalar genesis across three registers: the ontological, the epistemological and the discursive. Using a series of case studies such as an urban design project by Oscar Niemeyer in Lebanon, an experiment in cybernetic management in Chile, and the present issues surrounding the modeling and politics of the earths climate as exemplars of individuation at the scale of the city, the territory and the planetary, the thesis concludes by suggesting that every event of scalar genesis links together unique problematics across ontological, epistemological and discursive registers, in what is described as a chain of immanence. It concludes by suggesting that the political question of value with respect to scale can now return, but only in so far as this value is immanent to the scalar problematic in question.","2013","2022-10-06 16:55:53","2022-10-06 16:55:53","2022-10-06 16:55:53","","","","","","","The problem of scale","","","","","","","en","","Thesis","","","opus.lib.uts.edu.au","","Accepted: 2013-11-21T00:47:29Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawn from the theory of the firm in economics, this relational contracting approach focuses on how hierarchy reduces transaction costs and safeguards specific assets, and it explains the nature and persistence of hierarchy and why it develops in some strategic settings and not others. Relational contracting theory has clear limitations, however, whose gaps are highlighted and sometimes filled by alternative approaches to understanding hierarchy. Integrating relational contracting theory with these alternatives promises a more complete approach.","2009","2022-10-06 16:56:55","2022-10-06 16:56:55","2022-10-06 16:56:55","263-283","","1","12","","","Hobbesian Hierarchy","","","","","","","","","","","","Annual Reviews","","_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.041707.193640","","","","","authority; capitalism; transaction costs; state; empire; political parties; specific assets","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"ZADJMDRR","thesis","","Landenberg, Yanir","The Impact of Cultural Sensitivity on Business Growth in the Container Shipping Industry","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2433217124/abstract/1CB64790E9EC49FAPQ/1","For firms around the world, globalization brings new challenges as well as new opportunities. This process, in which information, products, people, money and technology cross national boundaries, has been rapidly growing (Walters 2001). In the current globalised business environment marked by diverse cultures and multiple interactions, recognition of cultural differences is critical. While globalization seeks to integrate different cultures in one standardized form, the culture, ethics, behaviour and local laws in each country or society serve to maintain local variations (Huff and Smith 2008). Based on an understanding of the inherent business potential of global markets, global firms have devoted efforts to searching for new markets both for selling their products and for finding more cost-efficient manufacturing opportunities (Johnson, Lenartowicz, and Apud, 2006; Walters 2001). The need to understand the systems involved in international institutions, new markets, and retail business has yielded an ongoing desire to enhance knowledge to support business (Dixon 1982, 1984, 1991). In a global business environment that includes person-to-person interactions, cross cultural gaps can become an obstacle that may negatively affect the outcome of business engagements. Sensitivity to cultural gaps and the ability to bridge them can positively impact the target of business engagements and thus enhance business (LaBahn and Harich, 1997; Su et al. 2008). This research aims to enhance knowledge regarding the impact of cultural sensitivity on business engagements in general and on sales performance in the container shipping industry in particular. The theoretical model used in this research is a mediation-based model emerging from market observations that were supported and reinforced by the literature review. The model is based on the notion that salespersons who are more culturally sensitive will develop higher level relationships with their customers. These relationships, in turn, will yield higher sales performance. The initial model was based on the positive effect of cultural sensitivity on relationship level found in the literature (Nguyen and Nguyen 2014). That initial model assumed that the correlation between the predictor variable of cultural sensitivity and the criterion variable of sales performance is mediated by the level of the salesperson-customer relationship. Yet the research findings provided no indication of the involvement of a mediation model. According to the results, relationship level plays no role in the relationship between cultural sensitivity and success in sales performance. Indeed, in cross-cultural business environments the component of cultural sensitivity is so significant in predicting performance that it renders the relationship level component statistically non-significant as a predictor of performance. This finding adds a very important layer of knowledge to global business regarding the importance of cultural sensitivity. Instead, the outcome of this research points to a different proposed model of cross-cultural sales engagements. The dimensions of relationship level, and primarily trust, that were previously assumed to be necessary for building a strong relationship with the business partner turned out to be statistically insignificant in predicting performance when cultural sensitivity is included in the model. In a cross-cultural business environment, sales can flourish without the necessity for a high relationship level with the customer so long as the salesperson maintains high cultural sensitivity. Furthermore, this study reviews topics complementary to the research: globalization, culture, cultural diversity, cultural sensitivity and relationship level, thus enhancing the body of knowledge regarding the impact of cultural sensitivity on business engagements in general and on sales performance in the container shipping industry in particular. The analysis is based on actual sales performance data and can thus provide global companies with practical knowledge regarding how cultural sensitivity and level of relationship between salesperson and customer are related to success in sales performance—the company's source of income.","","2022-10-06 16:58:35","2022-10-06 16:58:35","2022-10-06 16:58:35","","160","","","","","","","","","","Nottingham Trent University (United Kingdom)","England","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","D.B.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798662381032","","","","","Container shipping industry; Cost-efficient manufacturing opportunities; Mediation-based model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enterprise systems fall short in meeting these requirements The focus of planning and execution systems should move towards an inter-enterprise and event-driven mode. Inter-organizational systems may support planning going from supporting information exchange and henceforth enable synchronized planning within the organizations towards the capability to do network planning based on available information throughout the network. We provide a framework for planning systems, constituting a rich landscape of possible configurations, where the centralized and fully decentralized approaches are two extremes. We define and discuss agent based systems and in particular multi agent systems (MAS). We emphasize the issue of the role of MAS coordination architectures, and then explain that transportation is, next to production, an important domain in which MAS can and actually are applied. However, implementation is not widespread and some implementation issues are explored. In this manner, we conclude that planning problems in transportation have characteristics that comply with the specific capabilities of agent systems. In particular, these systems are capable to deal with inter-organizational and event-driven planning settings, hence meeting today’s requirements in supply chain planning and execution.","2008","2022-10-06 16:59:04","2022-10-06 16:59:04","2022-10-06 16:59:04","","","","","","","Multi Agent Systems in Logistics","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","supply chain; MAS; multi agent systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1290929","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identifying the Perpetuating Factors of a Racial Discipline Gap in an Urban Wisconsin Middle School","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2466001481/abstract/EFABA88181DB497EPQ/1","The purpose of this study was to find the primary influences of a racial discipline gap between White and Black or African American students in a diverse urban middle school in Southeastern Wisconsin. For Article One in this three-article dissertation, the researcher employed a cross-sectional quantitative study with descriptive statistics to examine and analyze the current cultural competence of the research school’s staff and draw connections as to how it influences the discipline data. Forty teachers participated in taking an anonymous Likert scale survey designed to elicit strengths and areas for growth in the area of cultural competence. Article Two focused on Black or African American students and sought to draw connections between their experiences at the research school and the disproportional discipline data. Fifty-two students in grades seven and eight participated in the research through an anonymous Likert scale survey designed to elicit their reality and assessment of the research school. Article Three compared the findings of articles one and two and discussed potential initiatives the research school could employ to increase cultural competence and mitigate the discipline gap. The study generated three connections: 1) the influence cultural divide has on teacher-to-student interactions and relationships; 2) confusion on how to address the achievement gap; and 3) teacher bias about student ability and achievement. These findings implied a need for the target school to engage in critical conversations about cultural competence and imbed ongoing professional development about implicit bias. These interventions can raise teacher awareness as to how their perceptions and responses to behaviors exhibited by Black or African American students promote the discipline gap at the research school.","","2022-10-06 17:00:22","2022-10-06 17:00:22","2022-10-06 17:00:22","","168","","","","","Maybe It’s Me?","","","","","Cardinal Stritch University","United States -- Wisconsin","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798691284724","","","","","Equity; Discipline gap; Implicit bias","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We are particularly motivated by studying covert networks that encode relationships among criminals. These data are subject to measurement errors, and exhibit a complex combination of an unknown number of core-periphery, assortative and disassortative structures that may unveil key architectures of the criminal organization. The coexistence of these noisy block patterns limits the reliability of routinely-used community detection algorithms, and requires extensions of model-based solutions to realistically characterize the node partition process, incorporate information from node attributes, and provide improved strategies for estimation and uncertainty quantification. To cover these gaps, we develop a new class of extended stochastic block models (ESBM) that infer groups of nodes having common connectivity patterns via Gibbs-type priors on the partition process. This choice encompasses many realistic priors for criminal networks, covering solutions with fixed, random and infinite number of possible groups, and facilitates the inclusion of node attributes in a principled manner. Among the new alternatives in our class, we focus on the Gnedin process as a realistic prior that allows the number of groups to be finite, random and subject to a reinforcement process coherent with criminal networks. A collapsed Gibbs sampler is proposed for the whole ESBM class, and refined strategies for estimation, prediction, uncertainty quantification and model selection are outlined. The ESBM performance is illustrated in realistic simulations and in an application to an Italian mafia network, where we unveil key complex block structures, mostly hidden from state-of-the-art alternatives.","2022-04-04","2022-10-06 17:31:39","2022-10-06 17:31:39","2022-10-06 17:31:39","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2007.08569 [stat] version: 4","","","","","Statistics - Methodology; Statistics - Applications; Statistics - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2007.08569","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The investigation sought to add to the sparse theoretical and empirical literature on the psychological study of nonviolence by investigating psychological dynamics that underlie nonviolent dispositions. Grounded by Kool's (1993) metatheoretical perspective of nonviolence, the study explored how proclivities towards nonviolence related to a developmental measure of conceptual functioning as articulated by Belief Systems Theory (BST) (Harvey, 1985, 1986), value priorities as elaborated by Values Theory (Schwartz, 1992, 1994), and an individual difference variable, social dominance orientation (SDO), as presented by Social Dominance Theory (Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle, 1994). The participants consisted of 173 adults who were college graduates. Each participant completed the Nonviolence Test, the “This-I-Believe” Test, the Values Survey, the Social Dominance Orientation Scale, and a demographic data sheet. Four of the hypotheses tested the relationship between nonviolence, stages of belief system functioning, specific value priorities, and social dominance orientation by calculating Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients. The fifth hypothesis examined how well belief systems functioning, value priorities, and social dominance orientation collectively predicted for proclivities towards nonviolence. Additionally, a hierarchical regression analysis was computed to determine if social dominance orientation and stages of belief system functioning significantly accounted for additional variance, beyond the effects of value priorities, in predicting proclivities towards nonviolence. Further regression analyses were conducted to elucidate differences in nonviolence scores among representatives of the various stages of conceptual functioning. Finally, patterns of responses were examined for each belief system group. Results of the study indicated that proclivities towards nonviolence related differently to a variety of values and attitudes, and are mediated by stage of conceptual functioning. Specifically, nonviolence related negatively with the lowest stage of conceptual functioning, the value types of power and hedonism, and SDO. Nonviolence correlated positively with the highest stage of conceptual functioning, and the value types of universalism and benevolence. Furthermore, significant differences in the patterns of nonviolent orientations were found among the stages of belief system functioning, suggesting that nonviolence cannot be simplistically understood as a monolithic construct. The findings of this study have implications for psychologists, educators, human-relations trainers, and other professionals interested in developing and implementing effective conflict resolution and peacemaking programs.","","2022-10-06 17:31:59","2022-10-06 17:31:59","2022-10-06 17:31:59","","164","","","","","","","","","","Fordham University","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780542021169","","","","","Psychology; Belief systems; Nonviolent; Social dominance; Value priorities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It sees the world as composed of systems, and all particular entities populating reality as linked with other entities – the emergence of new properties denies the flatland of plain materiality, and generates entities of a higher order. Spirituality in historical and modern traditions has minimally amounted to relating oneself to a larger or higher systemic whole, which confers meaning to particular cases of existence. In some religious traditions this larger systemic whole has been understood as a transcendental sphere of existence, whereas in other religious and spiritual traditions it has been seen as an immanent thatness. The search for spirituality and wisdom has never been confined to religious traditions, but has inspired other systems thinkers as well, for example in philosophy, the New Age movement, in developmental psychology, biology, or futures research. The American philosopher and theoretical psychologist Ken Wilber (b. 1949) has discussed, re-interpreted and synthesized various views on spiritual development as well as systems thinking and has provided input for the New Age movement, comparative religion, developmental psychology, and world philosophy. In this article we will discuss the relationship between systems thinking and spirituality and will assess Ken Wilber’s contribution to their conceptualization.","2015-11-17","2022-10-06 17:33:26","2022-10-06 17:33:26","2022-10-06 17:33:26","3-14","","2","5","","","Systems thinking, spirituality and Ken Wilber","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2015 Matti Kamppinen, JP Jakonen","","","","journal.fi","","Number: 2","","","","","Evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most significant is the recognition that the Chinese tributary order was in fact a viable and recognized international system with military, cultural, and economic dimensions that all intersected to create a very interesting and stable security system. Recently it has become fashionable in historical circles to question the viability of the tributary system in part because scholars have become increasingly aware of the realties behind Chinese rhetoric. However, more nuanced studies and new interpretations only serve to underscore the centrality of the system for its participants. This paper demonstrates that there is a hierarchical relationship—generated by a common culture defined by a Confucian worldview—in place in the context of China and the East Asian states and helps clarify the distinction between an international system based on polarity and an international society based on culture.","2010-11-23","2022-10-06 17:33:45","2022-10-06 17:33:45","2022-10-06 17:33:45","591-622","","4","19","","","Hierarchy and Legitimacy in International Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/09636412.2010.524079","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Vietnamese court explicitly recognized its unequal status in its relations with China through a number of institutions and norms.

Using data from 34 Muslim women college students we argue, first, that they are being racialized in similar practices and feel un-American and that they do not belong but how they mitigate racialization differs based on their intersecting identities. Specifically, the intersecting forces of nationality, gender and racial body signification, and religious-political expression are pertinent. Second, Muslim women college students negotiate their racialization with different coping strategies informed by their intersecting identities, notably their nationality and how they are bodily signified.

The analytic lens that this study employs to examine this society is the Indonesian middling classes' pursuit of modernity. The dissertation comes in two parts. Part One reconstructs the evolution of the Indonesian middling classes and their search for progress. Part Two uses three case studies to analyze the middling classes' search for Indonesian modernity under the New Order. The first explores the top-down modernization undertaken by President Soeharto's assistants at the National Development Planning Board, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology. The second case study investigates the ""bottom-up"" modernization performed by the Institute for Economic and Social Research, Education, and Information. The third case study deals with how several authors used popular fiction to criticize the kind of Indonesian modernity that emerged in the New Order era. This research yields several findings. First, the Indonesian middling classes championed a pragmatic, structural-functional path to modernity. Second, to modernize the country rapidly and safely, the modernizers proceeded in an eclectic and pragmatic manner. Third, between the Old and the New Order, there existed strong continuity in ideas, ideals, skills, and problems. Fourth, the middling classes' modernizing mission was fraught with contradictions, naiveties, ironies, and violence, which had roots in the nationalist movement in the first half of the twentieth century. The New Order was neither wholly new nor an aberration from the ""normal"" trajectory of Indonesia's contemporary history. The sort of modernity that the Indonesian middling classes ended up creating was Janus-faced.","","2022-10-06 17:35:15","2022-10-06 17:35:15","2022-10-06 17:35:15","","683","","","","","Indonesia's New Order, 1966-1998","","","","","Ohio University","United States -- Ohio","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781339152769","","","","","Social sciences; Language; Indonesia; Modernity; literature and linguistics; Middle class; New order; Non-governmental organizations; Think tanks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This dissertation focuses on the dependencies that emerge from the product system level and from technological knowledge, and their impact on interorganizational relations and the boundaries between firms. This thesis adopts the viewpoint of a focal firm that is either a systems integrator or incumbent firm engaged in technology acquisition, and is trying to manage these technological resource dependencies.    Publication I concentrates on concerns of how direct and indirect dependencies in a  network could be better understood. This approach was also applied in conceptual  publications II and III, which investigate the characteristics of buyer-supplier relationships and the make or buy question faced by a focal firm due to technological  resource dependencies, as well as the moderating role of the complexity of the product  system. Publication IV provides the main empirical part of this dissertation by leveraging  patent data with data on mergers and acquisitions. Statistical analyses of U.S. technology acquisitions in various high-technology industries confirm the expectation that the target firm prices increase, especially when many other firms directly or indirectly build on the target’s knowledge, as measured through patent citations. Thus, this thesis develops and empirically tests the hypothesis that the position of a target in its interorganizational resource dependence network affects the value of their resources to the acquirer, as reflected in the acquisition price.    This thesis mainly contributes to the theory of systems of production by suggesting that  technological resource dependencies at the technology and product system levels are the ones which influence where the boundaries of firms are, but there are technological knowledge level structures emerging from technological trajectories that set the directions of these dependencies. It is crucial to emphasize the sequence of tasks, such as design or production from the focal firm’s perspective, and thus the direction of technological resource dependencies, both direct and indirect, between the focal firm and other firms.","2018-10-12","2022-10-06 17:35:43","2022-10-06 17:35:48","2022-10-06 17:35:43","","","","","","","","","","","","Lappeenranta University of Technology","","eng","fi=Kaikki oikeudet pidätetään.|en=All rights reserved.|","","","","lutpub.lut.fi","","Accepted: 2018-10-02T08:07:39Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This result of studies that do not consider the variation within class groups by race is the framing of Black students - explicitly or implicitly – as a monolithic group with common identities, preferences, experiences, and adjustment to higher education contexts. Drawing from social identity frameworks (i.e,, Social Identity Theory, Tajfel & Turner, 1986; and the Multidimensional Framework of Social Class Identity, Webb, 2014), the current dissertation explores how social class identity processes help explain individual variation in Black college students’ psychological adjustment to predominantly White institutions. Using data from the College Academic and Social Identities Study (CASIS) I examined a sample of Black college students (n=375) over their first year of college and 1) identified latent profiles based on patterns of Black college students’ social class centrality and social class affect (pride, shame, and guilt) upon matriculating into college (Time 1). I also investigated if individuals’ social class self-identification was associated with membership in particular social class centrality and affect (pride, shame, guilt) profile groups in PWI contexts; 2) I examined how Black college students’ social class centrality and affect profiles were related to their Time 1 and Time 2 psychological adjustment outcomes; and 3) analyzed whether Black college students’ social class centrality and affect profiles moderated the associations between social class self-identification and psychological adjustment outcomes. Key findings show that Black college students vary in the extent to which they make meaning of the importance and emotions attached to their social class identity. There were significant differences by profile group in psychological adjustment outcomes. Profiles that included students who reported high levels of negative affect (shame and guilt) reported lower levels of adaptive psychological adjustment. Social class centrality and affect profile that included students who reported high levels of social class pride reported more adaptive psychological adjustment to the PWI context. However, the relation between social class self-identification and psychological adjustment did not vary as a function of social class centrality and affect profile group.","2020","2022-10-06 18:35:42","2022-10-06 18:35:42","2022-10-06 18:35:42","","","","","","","Class Matters","","","","","","","en_US","","Thesis","","","deepblue.lib.umich.edu","","Accepted: 2020-05-08T14:38:42Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The island attracts visitors eager to enjoy sweeping vistas uninterrupted by mega-resorts, casinos, strip malls, or golf courses and to relax on some of the best beaches in the Caribbean. The lack of fairways and five-star resorts stems in part from a lack of property available to develop in Vieques. For sixty years, the United States Navy owned three-quarters of the island's 33,000 acres including the most attractive oceanfront. Beginning in the 1940s, the Navy built an extensive network of munitions bunkers on the western portion of Vieques (approximately 9000 acres), and it used the eastern half of the island (approximately 17,000 acres) as a bombing range, live-fire training facility, and amphibious landing zone. On a strip of land in between the Navy's property, nearly ten thousand Puerto Rican residents made their homes. In 2003, after sixty years of military use, the Navy transferred the land to the Department of Fish and Wildlife and converted the Navy's proving grounds into the Vieques National Wildlife Refuge (VNWR). Land that once served as a target range for air-to-ground bombing and sea-to-shore shelling now serves as a sanctuary where endangered plants and animals thrive, largely untrammeled by human activity. The VNWR spurs ecotourism on the island and preserves much of the landscape from rampant development and privatization. Tourism guidebooks and travel literature praise the undeveloped and unblemished countryside in Vieques and claim that six decades of military occupation could not have turned out any better. But, where tourists and temporary visitors see pure and unspoiled landscapes all over the island, the Viequenses see camouflaged carcinogens. Military activity has transformed Vieques into one of the most contaminated places in the United States. The U.S. military dropped and fired hundreds of millions of pounds of munitions on the island between 1948 and 2001, and the chemical remnants of the ordnance linger in the environment. Dozens of scientific studies conducted over the last 25 years have identified contaminants in the local drinking water, plants, soil, and seafood, and the people of Vieques believe the toxins in their environment are making them sick. Abnormally high rates of infant mortality, cancer, hypertension, kidney failure, and respiratory ailments prevail in the community, and the Viequenses blame the U.S. military for their health problems. This dissertation explores the modern history of Vieques and unpacks the island's relationship with the Navy. It investigates why Vieques hosted the Navy's most important training facility and how the Viequenses responded and reacted to the militarization of their island. Vieques's history as a bombing range and highly contaminated wildlife refuge cannot be extricated from its history as a colony in the American empire. Although Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, without elected representatives in the U.S. House or Senate, Puerto Rican citizenship is inherently unequal. Limited by this skewed power dynamic, the people of Vieques have struggled to keep their land, have struggled to stop the bombing near their homes, and have failed to compel the Department of Defense to clean up the toxic mess that decades of bombing left behind. Without access to the corridors of Congress, the people of Vieques have opposed the Navy through civil disobedience and through the federal court system. Beginning in the 1970s, Viequenses adopted the discourse of environmentalism to protest the Navy's activities. Although environmentalism offered the people of Vieques a new way to oppose the Navy, environmental discourse and environmental laws yielded few results when pitted against an ideological heavyweight like the logic of American imperialism clothed in the raiment of national security. Furthermore, the rhetoric of environmentalism proved to be quite malleable, and the Department of Defense co-opted environmentalism and the laws born from it and ultimately employed them to reinforce the Navy's control of Vieques. Moreover, the federal courts have been unsympathetic to Viequenses' claims for redress, leaving the people with few options to compel the government to remediate their polluted yet seemingly pristine environment.","","2022-10-06 18:41:47","2022-10-06 18:41:47","2022-10-06 18:41:47","","228","","","","","A Disembodied Shade","","","","","University of California, Davis","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781303792137","","","","","Social sciences; Environmentalism; Caribbean; Puerto Rico; Tourism; Twentieth century; Vieques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a patriarchal society, women experience discrimination and their participation in decision making processes often is not allowed in domestic, political and economic affairs. Most women’s organizations mainly work to create a better, non-discriminatory, and equal society for women. To focus on this goal, these organizations often are not conscious of democracy at their own workplaces and equal participation of their members and employees in decision making. In addition, only a small amount of scholarship has been concerned with the structures and governance, organizational democracy, and women’s participatory roles in organizational decision making. By using a multiple case study design, this research explores the ways four advocacy women’s NGOs in Bangladesh promote women’s empowerment and equality at the organizational level and how organizational structures and internal decision making processes help NGOs to achieve these goals. None of the organizations has pure democratic or bureaucratic structure and participatory decision making process. More democratic organizational structures or participatory decision making processes are more effective in promoting more cognitive and psychological empowerment of its members and employees.","","2022-10-06 18:44:26","2022-10-06 18:44:26","2022-10-06 18:44:26","","200","","","","","Organizational Democracy and Women's Empowerment","","","","","Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University","United States -- Virginia","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781369754544","","","","","Social sciences; Decision-making; Participation; Empowerment; Advocacy organization; Bangladesh; Organizational democracy; Women's organizations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper I synthesize Austrian capital theory with general systems theory to analyze why these digital platforms have had such a large and relatively rapid impact. In large part this impact arises from certain architectural features of digital technologies and networks, particularly modularity, which enables digital platforms to change their scale of operations and be adaptable to unknown and changing conditions. Modularity reduces the costs of combining and reconfiguring combinations of individual elements in networks. Austrian capital theory’s focus on the combination of specific capital elements in production thus provides a valuable lens through which to analyze digital technology platforms and the economic reasons for their large and rapid development.","2020-02-11","2022-10-06 18:44:41","2022-10-06 18:44:41","2022-10-06 18:44:41","","","","","","","Plug-and-Play, Mix-and-Match","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","systems theory; modularity; Austrian capital theory; digital platforms; platform economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3537197","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are two facts that inspired me to begin this thesis. One is that a mother’s role is still critical for child development in spite of rapid social change. The other is the need to develop a pastoral counseling model based on stories in the Bible to help mothers have a healthier self-image. This thesis will thus analyze Korean women’s self-image from cultural, psychological and theological viewpoints and suggest a pastoral model to help women develop a more positive self-image.   There are many situations in Korean society that affect Korean women’s self-image negatively. This is critical, because a woman’s negative self-image can lead to her child also developing a negative self-image as a girl or woman. In addition, pastoral counseling faces many challenges. One is how pastoral counselors interpret social phenomena from theological viewpoint and the other is what pastoral model might be able to help them to fight the problems they are struggling. This is important because it is associated with finding the identity of pastoral counseling that differentiates it from other secular therapies.  In order to answer these challenges, this study will analyze Korean women’s negative self-image from cultural, psychological, and theological points of view. Chapter one will deal with the definition of their negative self-image and consider Confucianism as a mega cultural source affecting development of a negative self-image in Korean woman. Chapter two will look at family influence on their negative self-image development from a psychological view. Chapter three will consider theological analysis of development of self-image. The last chapter will suggest a pastoral model based on Jesus’ encounter with the Samaritan woman in John 5. This chapter will define this encounter as a moment of hope and will consider how Jesus changed that woman through three pastoral steps.","2017","2022-10-06 18:44:57","2022-10-06 18:44:57","2022-10-06 18:44:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_ca","","Thesis","","","tspace.library.utoronto.ca","","Accepted: 2018-02-02T19:57:34Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Implications on Gender Occupational Inequality","","","","","https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2583194","Whereas the rise of women’s rights globally has contributed to the expansion of women’s economic rights and women-friendly employment policies, it is an empirical question to ask if the expansion of women’s economic rights at the policy level has improved women’s economic rights, Particularly, while the impact of the welfare state on the quantity and quality of women’s employment is widely studied, little research has further investigated the ways other (non-welfare) types of policies affect women’s occupational opportunities. In this paper, I attempt to explain the level of gender occupational inequality in 2004 in 35 countries through cross-national variations in particular state policies in 1984. I create an original indicator of two types of policies: laws designed to help women combine employment and childrearing responsibilities (measured by a paid maternity leave policy) and laws that promote non-discrimination (measured by a policy that guarantees equal access to all occupations and a policy that guarantees equal remuneration). My data thus include three policies altogether: maternity-leave policies and two distinct forms of anti-discrimination policies. I find that state policies are the strongest determinants, compared to global and female human capital factors, of the gender occupational inequality but different types of policies have different impacts. Specifically, maternity leave is associated with a greater level of occupational gender inequality while anti-discrimination legislation is associated with less occupational inequality within countries. Although a panel analysis for a relatively small number of countries should not be overgeneralized, the results do introduce new information about policy-specific consequences for gender occupational inequality and provide a solid foundation for future research.","2014","2022-10-06 18:45:02","2022-10-06 18:45:02","2022-10-06 18:45:02","","","","","","","Do Women's Rights Policies Work?","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","equal employment policy; gender occupational inequality; maternity leave policy; women’s economic rights","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2583194","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extensive research shows that women-friendly policies at the national level and national integration into the global economy increase women's employment. However, it is unclear if either or both of these factors are linked to the quality of women's employment. This dissertation research argues that the way women are incorporated into the labor force is critical in determining if increased female labor force participation is linked to women's representation in higher status positions. This dissertation research integrates global and national policy theories to examine their implications on the quality of women's employment, utilizing quantitative pooled time-series analyses on women's relative chances to be employed in two higher-status occupational groups--managerial/administrative and professional/technical occupations. As key independent variables, original indicators of anti-discrimination and maternity leave policies that are comparable across developed and developing countries are created. This study not only provides a crucial test of those theories that suggest women's increased labor force participation leads to women's employment in high quality jobs and those that suggest the opposite, but also explains the factors that make one or the other outcome more likely. This research also advances sociological theories about the links between globalization, state policies, and actual employment outcomes on the ground by integrating state-centered and global theories of women's employment and testing the scope of theories in both developed and developing countries.This research finds that women's employment policies are important to the quality of women's employment, particularly in developing countries, as well as the levels of gender prejudice. Then, I discuss academic and policy implications of the main findings. The cross-national, historical research design makes findings from this project particularly applicable to diverse national contexts.","2012-10","2022-10-06 18:45:12","2022-10-06 18:45:14","2022-10-06 18:45:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","conservancy.umn.edu","","Accepted: 2014-12-19T16:03:16Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"IMQ37FTP","thesis","2016","Kim, Vadim","A design space exploration method for Identifying emergent behavior in complex systems","","","","","https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/56241","This research seeks to gain insight into the design of distributed multi-agent systems. Distributed multi-agent systems present opportunities for accomplishing a goal using multiple simple systems rather than a more complicated monolithic system. Distributed systems, if properly designed, have the potential to exhibit self-organizing behavior which can lead to systems that require less centralized control in addition to improved robustness, reliability, scalability, and adaptability than traditional monolithic, centralized systems. As engineered systems become more complex, their behavior is more difficult to characterize and predict. Self-organizing systems are difficult to analyze and design since the system behavior is emergent, i.e., the collective behavior only becomes apparent once the system is integrated. The collective behavior is primarily driven by the local interactions of the agents and their environment. This poses an enormous challenge for engineering these systems. The task of system design---selecting the right rules and system parameters---is difficult due to the opaque connection between inputs and responses. The goal of this research is to develop a methodology that provides a way of systematically exploring the design space in order to identify the conditions that give rise to emergent behavior. This information can be used as part of the scientific process of providing feedback through the iterative design process. In order to address this goal, this research seeks to answer the question on how to define, measure, and use the concept of emergence in the design of a multi-agent system. Similarly, it will address the more general question about how to understand ""complex systems"" in order to analyze and engineer them. This will be used to guide the development of an appropriate methodology. This research develops the Systematic Exploration for Emergence Detection (SEED) methodology for evaluating computer simulations of complex systems in order to identify conditions that lead to emergent behavior. This research proposes a new quantitative measure of emergence which can identify critical transitions in macro-level performance/function of the system due to changes in system context (i.e., environmental conditions or system parameters). The methodology provides the framework for performing a design space exploration using this measure of emergence to identify critical regions in the design space. These regions help to characterize the design space and will help guide the design process by providing insight into design points where the system behavior is unexpected or changing rapidly, which are possible indicators of emergent behavior. The SEED methodology is based on a statistical analysis approach. The design space is efficiently sampled using Design of Experiments methods. At each of these design points, the system behavior is characterized statistically using repeated runs of the simulation. The proposed measure of emergence, Design Space Divergence, is then evaluated across the design space and critical regions are identified using data visualization and clustering methods. A case study is performed on a multi-UAV distributed surveillance problem to investigate whether this framework is capable of identifying emergent behavior. The SEED methodology is used to explore the system design space, including the number of UAVs used in the system and influential vehicle and system parameters. The results show that this methodology provides insights into the landscape of system performance across the design space. More specifically, it identifies a number of candidate designs which exhibit emergent behavior where the system performance rapidly improves as the system undergoes a transition from disorganized to organized behavior. The SEED methodology provides for a more rigorous, traceable, and thorough design process for systems which have been difficult to understand and design using traditional engineering methods.","2016-08-23","2022-10-06 18:46:02","2022-10-06 18:46:04","2022-10-06 18:46:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_US","","","","","smartech.gatech.edu","","Accepted: 2017-01-11T14:01:33Z Publisher: Georgia Institute of Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their lived experience of being dislocated, their critical diasporic perspectives on colonial power, and their eagerness for justice and fullness of life can become creative epistemological, moral, and theological resources for fostering an alternative and transformative life-vision. This thesis explores how, by embracing their migrant hybridity, multiplicity, and in-between-ness, Asian migrant women play a creative agential role in devising resistant strategies against white colonialism, and in building respectful, border-crossing, and interdependent relationships with different others. Decolonial and collaborative solidarity-making with Indigenous women offers an exemplary expression of Asian migrant women’s embodied and hybrid agenthood and their moral capacity to bring out a hopeful future. Working against the entangled white settler colonial structures of gender-based violence, racism, patriarchal imperialism, and cultural genocide, both groups of women weave a potentially alternative model of life that offers the co-benefits of liberation, mutual dependency, and interrelatedness.  Asian migrant women’s performances of creating border-crossing hospitable circles of life with vulnerable others through relationality, mutuality, and solidarity, become a significant enactment of a radical vision of Christian hospitality. This thesis explores how Asian migrant women embody can God’s hospitality in their migrant contexts, by weaving interactive, inclusive, and open-ending community with strangers across difference and barriers, so that all can find true welcome, empowerment, and wholeness. Through their imaginative practices, the essential nature of ecclesia is actualized temporally and spatially, in which marginal and vulnerable bodies can experience God’s redemptive power, restoration, and liberation in the conflicted and fragmented time and place of migration.","2021-11","2022-10-06 18:46:23","2022-10-06 18:46:23","2022-10-06 18:46:23","","","","","","","Toward Postcolonial Practice and Theology of Radical Hospitality in Canadian Diasporic Contexts","","","","","","","en_ca","","Thesis","","","tspace.library.utoronto.ca","","Accepted: 2022-01-05T13:34:30Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The conditions peculiar to modern mass society, therefore, effect the individuals formation of self.</p> <p>A discussion of mass society in the first section of the thesis sets the stage for the examination of the individual in this society in the latter half. Mass society is a highly stratified differentiated social system. It is ""classless"" only to the degree that mass culture has standardized consumption. Individuals in contemporary society live the paradox of equality in terms of consumption but inequality in terms of the occupational status hierarchy. This paradox is a function of social control. The individual is manipulated within this social context, consumption becoming a superficial status equalizer which does not change the fundamental stratification pattern.</p> <p>Individuals of lower occupational stratum have more difficulty forming an identity within this social system than those of higher occupational levels. Their occupations do not demand commitment, therefore they do not include high degrees of socialization. The result is that individuals of lower occupational status do not identify with their work. They suffer from an ""incomplete"" identity; they are dominated, therefore, by the identity which they formed under the conditions of primary socialization. They cannot internalize the reality of secondary socialization.</p> <p>The individual, however, does not become dissatisfied or recognize the source of his identity problems. Instead. he is lulled or compensated by the production-consumption system which created his identity problems. The wealth of conspicuous consumption which serves as status symbols no longer serves the purpose of status differentiation. Instead, consumption serves a ""new"" compensatory function. This new function takes the form of production images, made up of a combination of material goods which serve as the props for a manufactured, highly visible style or ""identity"". Lower status individuals who are still attempting to achieve higher status assume extra-occupational roles; individuals who resign themselves to their low status seek only to mask this status, therefore they assume these production images.</p>","1976","2022-10-06 18:47:14","2022-10-06 18:47:14","2022-10-06 18:47:14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","thesis","","","macsphere.mcmaster.ca","","Accepted: 2014-06-18T16:52:06Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we develop an information-theoretic measure of multi-scale integration in multivariate systems. This quantifies the strength of interactions in subsystems of different sizes, where size is defined relative to some underlying distance metric. We apply this measure to MRI recordings of the human brain and show that it provides meaningful characterization of different brain areas. Second, we consider modularity , a pattern of organization in which systems are composed of weakly-coupled subsystems. We propose two different methods to identify modular decompositions of multivariate dynamical systems. The first is based on statistical learning of dynamics; it uses model selection to choose decompositions that optimize a trade-off between capturing dependencies (favoring large-scale modules) and model simplicity (favoring small-scale modules), with the trade-off controlled by a parameter representing the amount of available data. The second method is based on perturbations to system dynamics; it finds decompositions having subsystems that maximally constrain the spread of perturbations over time, with the time scale acting a resolution parameter. We apply the method to several non-linear dynamical systems and also show that it is a generalization of community-detection techniques based on random walks on graphs. These approaches to studying multi-scale integration and modularity are novel: while measures of multi-scale integration have been investigated theoretically, they have not been extended to consider real-world, spatially-embedded systems; on the other hand, while much work has been done on identifying modular decompositions in real-world graphs, the problem has received little attention in the domain of multivariate dynamical systems. Thus, our work provides new tools for analyzing multivariate dynamics and time-series.","","2022-10-06 18:49:30","2022-10-06 18:49:30","2022-10-06 18:49:30","","167","","","","","Measuring scales","","","","","Indiana University","United States -- Indiana","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781321742244","","","","","Dynamical systems; Complexity; Information theory; Applied sciences; Modularity; Integration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since Waltz's Theory of International Politics, it has been assumed that states are formally equal sovereign unitary actors operating in an anarchic world system and that their identities and interests are defined by the very existence of anarchy. This article shatters this conception. It offers a ‘hierarchical worldview’ in order to illustrate that the very concepts of state, sovereignty, and anarchy are discursive creations inherently tied to the practice of hierarchy. I use a case study of Japanese national identity to illustrate this practice. The narratives of Japan as an autonomous and sovereign state were inextricably linked to Japan's hierarchical relationship toward Asia and the West (pre-war) and the USA (post-war). Japan's sovereignty and autonomy were then formulated within the practice of hierarchy.","2018-09","2022-10-06 18:49:40","2022-10-06 18:49:40","2022-10-06 18:49:40","507-518","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A.","Who benefits from the Russia sanctions? – Trade diversion and destruction since 2014","","","","","https://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/35350","This paper hypothesizes that Western sanctions and Russian countersanctions in the aftermath of the  crisis in Ukraine starting in 2013 exert a negative effect on aggregated trade flows between senders  and target country. Moreover, the paper hypothesizes a general Russian trade diversion due to the  Russian political and economic disintegration with the West and the resulting Russian reorientation  toward Asia and particularly China. While such economic sanctions as well as other trade barriers serve  as explanatory variables for bilateral trade in a high number of studies, the effect on third parties is  often  overlooked.  Hence,  the  present  paper  ties  in  with  prior  literature  on  the  effectiveness  of  sanctions as well as the trade effect of sanctions and focuses on a potential third-party effect.  In line  with vast parts of the literature on the trade destruction effect of sanctions, the direct trade effect of  sanctions as well as the countersanctions was found to be negative. In contrast, evidence on trade  diversion  could  not  be  observed  by  means  of  a  gravity  model  approach  with  some  results  even  indicating  further  trade  destruction,  i.  e.  a  negative  trade  effect  on  bystanders.  The  main  policy  implication for the effectiveness of sanctions and thus the EU CSDP is that economic adjustment in the  sense of trade diversion to other countries appears neither to bust sanctions nor serve as a viable  method for evasion.","2019","2022-10-06 18:49:51","2022-10-06 18:49:51","2022-10-06 18:49:51","","","","","","","Who benefits from the Russia sanctions?","","","","","","","en_US","CC-BY-NC-ND","Master Thesis","","","studenttheses.uu.nl","","Accepted: 2020-02-20T19:07:15Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In effect, the last word on this subject was written in 1911 by German sociologist Robert Michels in his book Political Parties. Michels' now famous ""iron law of oligarchy"" states that oligarchy is inherent to, or synonymous with, organization and excludes possibilities for egalitarian structures even among the most ideologically committed. Most recently the women's literature has offered a challenge to the iron law. This literature suggests that feminist theory might be central to the development of non-hierarchical forms of organization. The purpose of this research is to identify and explore feminist claims with regard to organizations. Of particular interest is anarchist feminist theory which holds, as a goal, the development of non-hierarchical structure. The major research question is: to what extent have anarchist feminists been able to create and maintain non-hierarchical structures while still attaining, to a reasonable extent, organization goals? Consideration of this question leads to an examination of the literature of organizations with regard to hierarchy and non-hierarchy. While the concept of non-hierarchical organization is not new, or exclusively a feminist notion, anarchist feminists have brought renewed attention to the subject which has been overshadowed by a dominant perspective that hierarchy is inevitable. Specifically, this study is a qualitative analysis of three feminist organizations in a small New England city. Research methods include personal observation of organization meetings over a two-year period, researching of documents related to organization history, as well as personal interviews with approximately 40 women drawn from the three organizations. Findings are that feminist political ideals do have an impact on the structure of, in particular, the two anarchist organizations within this study. A major contribution of this research is the distinction made between types of leadership and decision-making patterns characteristic of feminist consensual organizations of the women's movement during the 1960s and 70s, and the modified consensual structures developed by feminists of the 1980s.","","2022-10-06 18:50:14","2022-10-06 18:50:14","2022-10-06 18:50:14","","215","","","","","","","","","","The Pennsylvania State University","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798617046016","","","","","Social sciences; [email protected]; Anarchy; Oligarchy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research into the impact of contemporary mechanical means of musical reproduction has tended to divert attention away from the study of live performance. But the two major music traditions in western Industrial societies, Western European Art Music (WEAM) and Afro-American have their origins in the pre-recording era. Consideration of the development of their forms must take into account the changing contexts within which they were performed. The development of notation coupled with the emphasis on composition within WEAM facilitated the rise of an aesthetic autonomy for the 'work' giving rise to the most appropriate context for its performance: the purpose built modern concert hall celebrating in its rituals and relations a particular form of aesthetic address. The Afro-American tradition with its roots in disadvantaged and dominated black culture, and its emphasis on improvisation rather than formal composition, is less autonomous and is mediated more closely by the social relations of the contexts within which it is performed. Observations of various performance venues was undertaken, using a comparative frame developed from that used by Qureshi (1987) modified to take into account the comrnodification of music in an economic market. Observations were supported by interviews of jazz musicians about attitudes to performance and preferred settings. Two venues have been selected for detailed consideration: The Royal Festival Hall (a classical concert) and The Pontalba Cafe (a Jazz cafe in New Orleans). On the basis of the observations, the Interviews and consideration of the current literature, models of aesthetic ideology are constructed. It is suggested that there is an homology between 'fixed' forms and 'tight' contexts and 'flexible' forms and 'loose' contexts.","1992","2022-10-06 18:52:04","2022-10-06 18:52:04","2022-10-06 18:52:04","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Social Sciences Theses","","en","","Thesis","","","bura.brunel.ac.uk","","Accepted: 2010-05-07T10:05:59Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I analyzed and profile plantations as dynamic spaces of intricate and intimately connected communities of people actively engaged in developing strategies for living, surviving, and managing life in racialized spaces. My study counters silences, gaps, and fixed representations of identity in public discourse of African people and communities in plantation spaces in America. Colonial and antebellum accounts of plantation life typically caricature persons of African descent solely as slaves. Reducing discussion of Africans in plantation spaces to slave life portraits perpetuates a narrow vision of Africans in American history. A survey of antebellum plantations in the southeast coastal region of the United States showed that they were largely populated by Africans and people of African descent. In South Carolina, census records from as early as 1790 confirm that Africans made up most of the population in plantation communities; and performed the wide range of jobs and tasks that enabled plantation-based agricultural production centers to function relatively self-sufficiently. Today, descendents of enslaved Africans, descendents of plantation owners, and others continue to interact and manage relations on a variety of levels and in a variety of ways in former antebellum plantation communities and elsewhere throughout America. This analysis of Jehossee Island and Snee Farm plantations in South Carolina and Kingsley Plantation in Florida profiles the scope, complexity, and heterogeneity of life in plantation spaces in America, in the past and in the present.","","2022-10-06 18:52:15","2022-10-06 18:52:15","2022-10-06 18:52:15","","288","","","","","","","","","","University of Florida","United States -- Florida","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780496943302","","","","","Social sciences; Communities; Slavery; African diaspora; Plantation; Southeast coastal region","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we address the challenges that arise in implementing reliably and conveniently to use distributed data structures, such as lists or sets, in such a distributed hash-table-based online social network. We present a secure, distributed list data structure that manages the list entries in several buckets in the distributed hash table. The list entries are authenticated, integrity is maintained and access control for single users and also groups is integrated. The approach for secure distributed lists is also applied for prefix trees and sets, and implemented and evaluated in a peer-to-peer framework for social networks. Evaluation shows that the distributed data structure is convenient and efficient to use and that the requirements on security hold.","2014-05","2022-10-06 19:09:37","2022-10-06 19:09:37","","396-405","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","","","Social network services; Access control; Data structures; distributed data management; Distributed social networks; network security; Peer-to-peer computing; peer-to-peer networks; Public key","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2014 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus of this study is at the division level and a division's new product location choice vis-à-vis its own products (intra-divisional new product distance), the products of a rival division of competing firms (inter-firm divisional new product distance), and the products of a sister division of the same firm (intra-firm divisional new product distance). The hypotheses were tested using data on the U.S. automobile industry between 1979 and 1999. The results show that a focal division with a high level of inter-firm divisional domain overlap with a rival division, relative to the focal division's own domain, is more likely to locate its new product (here new car model) closer to that rival's existing car models. And it was also found that divisional density affects a division's new product location choice. But this study didn't find any significant role of divisional status on new product location choice. And contrary to our expectation, the results of intra-firm divisional domain overlap and new product location choice suggest that inter-divisional product cannibalization might not be such an important concern when divisions introduce their new products, as we had originally expected. By addressing the firm's competitive engagement in the context of a division's new product location choice, this study expands the basic logic of market overlap at the firm level into the unit- or division-level, and highlights how a division's new product location choice is affected by intra-firm divisional structural relationship as well as inter-firm divisional structural relationship. In so doing, this study hopes to contribute to the literature on divisionalization, new product location choice, competition at the unit-level, and product cannibalization, among others.","","2022-10-06 19:12:35","2022-10-06 19:12:35","2022-10-06 19:12:35","","173","","","","","Divisionalization, product cannibalization and product location choice","","","","","Texas A&M University","United States -- Texas","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780496649068","","","","","Social sciences; Divisionalization; Automobile industry; Cannibalization; Product location","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to solve these problems, we introduce the complex system theory and develop the TC Scale with nine items for team creativity from three dimensions: team creative thinking, team creative action and team creative outcome. The data is collected from three distinct positions of respondents (managers, team leaders and senior staff) in 183 creative teams. The results of reliability measures, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis strongly support our scale.

A rhesus macaque population was introduced into Silver Springs State Park (SSSP) in central Florida in the mid-1930s and has spread into the Ocala National Forest. The study group, 14km northeast of the original population in SSSP, along the Dead River experiences no observed intergroup competition, is not provisioned, and has access to abundant and distributed food throughout the riverine floodplain. Rhesus macaques are considered the archetypal species for phylogenetic inertia, an evolutionary adaptation to past ecological conditions, which then produced a static behavioral pattern. Over 231.5 hours of observation during June and July of 2016, the Dead River macaque group was observed to break from the species-typical pattern of high levels of agonism and a steep, stable hierarchy, and instead demonstrated a shallow hierarchy with infrequent agonism in a feeding context. This indicates that rhesus macaques are capable of significantly changing behavior when living under novel ecological conditions. A deeper understanding of the relationship between primate species and their environment is essential to addressing the anthropogenic pressure placed on other species that experience phylogenetic inertia but are also at risk from human encroachment and anthropogenic climate change.","","2022-10-06 19:13:45","2022-10-06 19:13:45","2022-10-06 19:13:45","","63","","","","","Strangers in a New Land","","","","","The University of North Carolina at Charlotte","United States -- North Carolina","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781369742718","","","","","Psychology; Ecology; Macaca; Biological sciences; Agonism; Grouping; Niche construction; Phylogenetic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It explains why it is possible that, despite the recurrence of ethnic tensions in a multicultural state like the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, a country that bridges the Arab and African worlds, an enduring accommodation amongst authoritarian elites from the country's different ethnic groups has developed. This dissertation contributes to the nascent body of literature on the failed democratic transitions of developing countries, or process of ‘authoritarian restoration.’ It explores two under-theorized aspects of the interaction between the regime change and cultural pluralism literatures. First, I analyze political tensions within ethnic groups and accommodative relations among ruling elites of diverse ethnic groups. I show that even if elites from the country's different ethnic groups often struggle against one another, along ethnic lines and along factional lines, they also fight within an agreed-upon structure that denies wider political participation for the population. In other words, ruling elites of different ethnic origins share common interests in preserving the authoritarian regime, as well as common norms about how relations between the rulers and the ruled ought to be organized. These shared interests and norms allow them to better resist domestic and international pressure for democratization and to maintain the basis of the authoritarian regime. Second, I analyze the symbolic and dramaturgical dimensions of political relations. Such a premise pertains to a larger conception of dramas as social moments that can directly or indirectly affect political relations and in which political actors fully engage one another. I compare three political dramas in Mauritania: a party congress, an Islamic ritual, and a presidential tour to the country's peripheral regions. I show that the shared interests and norms of the ruling ethnic elites are, in part, constructed and communicated through dramaturgical performances. In the course of political dramas, ruling ethnic elites fought one another by way of dramaturgical performances, but they simultaneously resisted domestic and international demands for democratization, by staging their elite solidarity and by symbolically conveying the restrictive definition of the rulers-ruled relationship they value.","","2022-10-06 19:14:15","2022-10-06 19:14:15","2022-10-06 19:14:15","","396","","","","","Dramas of ethnic elites accommodation","","","","","The University of Wisconsin - Madison","United States -- Wisconsin","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493639857","","","","","Social sciences; Elites; Authoritarian; Ethnic; Mauritania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Applying this insight to the early modern Atlantic world and focusing especially on the British American colony of Virginia, this dissertation asks anew what kind of polities the founders of the American colonies believed they were establishing and how those individuals' efforts to realize their state-building ideals shaped colonial political culture. Through an analysis of a wide range of contemporary documents, the study finds that Virginia leaders brought to the colonial venture a considerably more sophisticated conception of what constituted, and how to construct, a civil society than historians have usually realized. Striving to establish in Virginia a “commonwealth” in which human “passions” were sufficiently restrained to safeguard both authority and liberty, the colony's leaders concluded that the only way that they could ever create the authority that they deemed necessary to support civilized life was by leaning upon a supposedly natural tendency in humans to feel a powerful sense of obligation toward their benefactors. By granting to settlers all of the benefits that they expected from English government, including not only protection but also liberty, these men believed, Virginia's government could secure those inhabitants' “natural obedience.” By tracing the influence of this idea through a century and a half of Virginia politics, including the regular attacks that local politicians waged against the colony's governors as well as the steady crystallization of racial beliefs that identified some Virginia inhabitants as so unresponsive to generosity that they deserved to be permanently excluded from full membership in colonial society, the dissertation attempts to demonstrate that the overriding logic of those politics was the desire not, as historians have typically argued, to safeguard liberties for their own sake or to enhance personal wealth and power, but rather to preserve those conditions deemed necessary to maintain the people's gratitude, or “affection,” and therefore their obedience.","","2022-10-06 19:15:29","2022-10-06 19:15:29","2022-10-06 19:15:29","","434","","","","","“The affections of the people”","","","","","The Johns Hopkins University","United States -- Maryland","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780496163441","","","","","Social sciences; Politics; Ideology; Colonial; Intellectual history; State-building; Virginia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I argue that this authority and legitimacy was established through the king’s ability to encompass the subordinate lords of his realm, in effect making them aspects of his own persona and not autonomous agents. The king’s ability to achieve this effect was an inherently intersubjective phenomenon that relied on the perceptions of other social beings, most notably the commoners that the subordinate lords oversaw. By engaging subordinate lords in specific material practices such as unilateral or asymmetric exchange, the king was able to cause commoners to perceive that the king was the primary agent that endowed subordinate lords with the capacity to act meaningfully, and on his behalf. The ability of the subordinate lords to act on their own behalf was severely compromised, because the commoners who witnessed their actions were led to perceive, through the presence of material objects and the social practices behind those objects, the king’s agency in the actions of the subordinate lords. I demonstrate that the king was able to encompass the subordinate lords of two sites in the Tarascan core zone, the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin. I achieve this through both ethnohistoric and archaeological investigations. I first analyze how certain discursive practices and narratives, contained in the ethnohistoric record, publicly proclaimed the histories of those social agents and material objects involved in the realization of any act, leading witnesses to perceive that he was the primary motivating and enabling agent in the actions of the subordinate lords. Additionally, I use the ethnohistoric record to identify material correlates of the realization of these material practices. Lastly, I examine the object biographies of those material objects that the king relied upon in his ability to encompass the subordinate lords. Witnesses would have made their inferences according to not only the discursive framing that surrounded particular actions or objects, but also the histories of those objects and whose agencies had gone into the production of their existence in the hands of the subordinate lords.","","2022-10-06 19:15:39","2022-10-06 19:15:39","2022-10-06 19:15:39","","365","","","","","Tarascan kingship","","","","","University of Florida","United States -- Florida","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781109024562","","","","","Social sciences; Hierarchy; Mexico; Materiality; Patzcuaro Basin; Personhood; Political structure; Prehispanic; State formation; Tarascan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The assumption grounding the study is that cultural discourses produce a social reality which then guides the actions and experiences of the sojourner. The ethnographic methods of interviews and participant observation were used to study sojourner discourse. The analyses in the dissertation relied primarily upon transcribed interview data in making claims about patterns in sojourner discourse. The analytic results suggest that sojourner discourses are efficacious in facilitating adaptation to the host setting. Indian sojourners presented codes of identity which created predictable kinds of cultural identities. The reality produced in the talk of the sojourners provided a basis for social relations with members of each of the focal groups. The sojourners symbolically positioned themselves somewhere between the American and Indian identities by appropriating symbols from each in self-reference. The findings suggest that cultural adaptation is not a universally experienced set of phases, but that sojourners groups may creatively develop symbolic resources for dealing with the exigencies of the host setting.","","2022-10-06 19:15:46","2022-10-06 19:15:46","2022-10-06 19:15:46","","287","","","","","Cultural discourses on identity and morality by Asian Indians in the United States","","","","","University of Massachusetts Amherst","United States -- Massachusetts","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798209346784","","","","","Social sciences; Communication and the arts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although a significant amount of evidence suggests that people seek power and status, there is a general emphasis in the extant literature on hierarchy acceptance and reinforcement. This dissertation examines the actions people take to challenge and modify the hierarchies of which they are a part, particularly in response to structural characteristics of those hierarchies. Chapter 1 introduces the central concepts investigated in the dissertation. Chapter 2 examines the effects of status hierarchy dispersion and legitimacy on group members' behaviors. Two studies indicate that hierarchy dispersion increases individuals' motivation to attain high status, particularly in hierarchies perceived to be illegitimate, leading to status challenges, which are detrimental for group performance. Chapter 3 investigates the interaction of power and legitimacy on the tendency to conform to social norms. Whereas legitimate power decreases conformity to norms, illegitimate power increases conformity, compared to being powerless. Chapter 4 examines how people value power and status distinctly. There is a general tendency for people to place greater importance on status, defined as the respect they receive from others, compared to power, the control they have over valuable resources. This is moderated by gender, with men tending to value power more than women, and women valuing status more than men. Furthermore, whereas legitimacy does not change the value of having power, legitimate status is significantly more valuable than illegitimate status. Chapter 5 captures common themes across the projects, identifies implications for researchers and organizations, and highlights additional questions that should be addressed in future research.","2012","2022-10-06 19:15:53","2022-10-06 19:15:53","2022-10-06 19:15:53","","","","","","","Social Climbing","","","","","UCLA","","en","","","","","escholarship.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"ZPUQ24XR","thesis","","Haughton, James Francis","Education reform: working towards quality music service provision","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/301533987/abstract/FFC87E2FAA514BA2PQ/1","Sexton (1987) asserted that standards in education could most effectively be raised through responsiveness to customers and competition within the market-place. It has also been argued that the quality of educational provision could be raised using the same mechanisms. The Education Reform Act 1988, and the Education Act 1993 effectively paved the way for the development of a market for education. This market extends to all mainstream educational organisations including non-statutory services such as Local Education Authority maintained Music Services. This research project examines the extent to which the Education Reform Act 1988 and the Education Act 1993 have affected the quality of Music Service provision. Chapter 1 describes the context of this research project, and Chapter 2 examines literature relating to a range of issues which have had significant bearing on the quality of Music Service provision in recent years. These issues include the Conservative Administration's (1979-1997) objectives to reduce and decentralise public expenditure, which subsequently had considerable impact on employment practice. In response to this, the notions of professionalism, proletarianization and casualization are explored in some depth. Chapter 2 continues with a review of literature relating to the management of quality, which is fundamental to survival within a competitive environment, and it concludes with a brief history of Music Service provision in England and Wales. Chapter 3 details the research methods employed in this project. The conclusions, presented in Chapter 5, demonstrate that Music Service funding has been reduced or withdrawn in recent years. It is argued that this has resulted in staffing economies and efficiencies which include increased workloads for full-time staff, and an increase in the use of part-time, sessional and 'unqualified' staff. This may mean that actual standards of attainment are unwittingly depressed, particularly where pupils receive short lessons in large groups with staff who may have no formal qualifications in pedagogy, and in some cases fell little commitment due to relatively poor conditions of service.","","2022-10-06 19:16:04","2022-10-06 19:16:04","2022-10-06 19:16:04","","474","","","","","Education reform","","","","","University of Leicester (United Kingdom)","England","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781073227020","","","","","Education; (UMI)AAIU105436; Education Act 1993; Education Reform Act 1988","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to gather evidence on how culture relates to the aetiology and phenomenology of mental disorders, finding meaningful empirical instruments for capturing the latent (i.e. non-visible) construct of ?culture? is vital. In this review, we suggest using value orientations for this purpose. We focus on Schwartz's value theory, which includes two levels of values: cultural and personal. We identified nine studies on personal values and four studies on cultural values and their relationship with common mental disorders. This relationship was assessed among very heterogeneous cultural groups; however, no consistent correlational pattern occurred. The most compelling evidence suggests that the relationship between personal values and mental disorders is moderated by the cultural context. Hence, assessing mere correlations between personal value orientations and self-reported symptoms of psychopathology, without taking into account the cultural context, does not yield meaningful results. This theoretical review reveals important research gaps: Most studies aimed to explain how values relate to the aetiology of mental disorders, whereas the question of phenomenology was largely neglected. Moreover, all included studies used Western instruments for assessing mental disorders, which may not capture culturally-specific phenomena of mental distress. Finding systematic relationships between values and mental disorders may contribute to making more informed hypotheses about how psychopathology is expressed under different cultural circumstances, and how to culturally adapt psychological interventions.","2019-06-01","2022-10-06 19:16:41","2022-10-06 19:16:41","2022-10-06 19:16:41","449-470","","3","56","","Transcult Psychiatry","Value Orientations and Mental Health","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model is estimated on data obtained from the City of Lansing, Michigan between FY 1969-70 and FY 1984-85. Using ""incremental budgeting theory"" as a basis, the model focuses on how officials include the environment in their decision rules and its impact on budget levels. This study argues that previous incremental budgeting models inadequately represent environmental effects and that this indicates a fundamental deficiency with the underlying theory. Specifically, the theory does not specify how officials' decision rules change under varying environmental circumstances. The model's form and content are developed in response to various criticisms of incremental budgeting that target its inability to explain recent budgeting trends and some past budgeting outcomes. Underlying this theory is a set of assumptions that describe decision making as""intendedly rational."" Many of the theory's critics argue that the unexplained behavior is not characteristic of intendedly rational decision making, and therefore, a new theory of budgeting should be developed. In contrast, this research claims that the underlying assumptions and major findings of incremental budgeting theory are still very useful as a foundation for modeling budgeting, but some theoretical changes must be made to account for the unexplained behavior. The model estimated here exhibits two major changes in the incremental theory of budgeting. First, two new sets of assumptions concerning the environment's structure and its effect on the budgeting process in general and budgeting decisions in particular are added to the theory's fundamental assumptions. Using these assumptions, a set of variables is proposed which represents the decision makers perceptions of the environment. The variables target the wealth and uncertainty of the government (as an indicator of the environment's stability, complexity and supply of resources) and its policy priorities (as an indicator of environmental demand). Second, the general form of the budgeting model is altered to represent the decision making process in two stages. The proposed model is then estimated using pooled cross-sectional time series analysis which allows budgeting behavior to be explained both across time and budgeting units.","","2022-10-06 19:16:48","2022-10-06 19:16:48","2022-10-06 19:16:48","","268","","","","","Towards a Theory of Budgeting","","","","","Michigan State University","United States -- Michigan","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798205963411","","","","","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Essay 1, I utilize the stock recommendation decisions made by security analysts to focus on the social hierarchical nature of status and to examine its unique role in imitative behavior. This paper contributes to our understanding of the role that status plays in imitative behavior by expanding the theoretical and conceptual boundaries of the factors likely to lead to imitation. I find that the stock recommendations issued by high status analysts – analysts listed on Institutional Investor's All-America Research Team – lead to subsequent changes in the recommendations issued by other analysts. In Essay 2, I examine the role that status plays in the board's selection of a new CEO after CEO dismissal. I propose that negative investment analyst recommendations convey a lack of confidence in the strategic direction of the firm and pose a threat to the firm's legitimacy, which motivates the board to restore the firm's legitimacy through the appointment of a high status CEO. This paper contributes to our understanding of the contextual factors that influence executive succession. I find that negative analyst recommendations increase the likelihood that the board will appoint a CEO with high status and/or an outsider CEO. In Essay 3, I seek to address several of the shortcomings in the extant literature on the stock market reaction to CEO succession. This is one of the first studies on CEO succession to make an analytical distinction between CEO appointment and CEO departure, as well as one of the first to examine whether the new CEO's status influences the stock market reaction to his/her appointment. I find that investors respond positively to the appointment of a new CEO only when the prior CEO was dismissed in an earlier announcement. I also find that the appointment of a high status CEO leads to a significant positive stock market reaction only when the firm's pre-succession stock return was high and/or analysts upgraded their stock recommendations prior to the appointment.","","2022-10-06 19:17:20","2022-10-06 19:17:20","2022-10-06 19:17:20","","175","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Irvine","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781303143281","","","","","Social sciences; Status; Board of directors; CEO appointments; Executive succession; Imitation; Investment analysts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It analyzes how marginalized groups within a dominant sociocultural knowledge regime strategize to advance change while trying to maximize security and optimize their life options. The case study analyzes primaries held within kin-based groupings? hamulas (clans) among Palestinian Arabs in Israel?to determine the candidates for municipal elections. Based on interviews and analysis of newspaper articles, the authors claim that the turn to primaries by hamulas was an attempt to resolve disputes that were undermining the patriarchal system. The primaries provided entry to those of lower ranking in the hierarchy of hamula political leadership (e.g., younger men, higher education graduates, members of marginal segments of the clan), while retaining the exclusion of women from the political sphere. Thus, while bargaining with patriarchy, gender identities and hierarchies are contested, re/produced, and negotiated as both a political means and an anchor for social identities.","2007-08-01","2022-10-06 19:17:38","2022-10-06 19:17:38","2022-10-06 19:17:38","579-602","","4","21","","","Men's Bargaining with Patriarchy","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gender role literature is reviewed from a deconstructivist perspective and a theoretical basis for examining hegemonic values is established. The subjects were 155 men and women, over the age of eighteen, living in Los Angeles, Orange, and Ventura counties. The subjects completed a questionnaire which included the following instruments: The Brannon and Juni Masculinity Scale (1983), a ""Peace Scale,"" a ""War Scale,"" a ""Dominance Scale,"" a ""Hierarchy Scale,"" and an ""Instrumentalism Scale,"" and a demographic questionnaire. Results indicated that endorsement of traditional male roles was significantly positively correlated with acceptance of war and significantly, negatively correlated with acceptance of peace. Furthermore, hegemonic values were strongly associated with traditional male roles. In a multiple regression, war was associated most strongly with the male roles promoting toughness, violence, and self-reliance. Barriers to peace include the male roles of violence and seeking admiration and respect. Overall, male roles appear to be greater impediments to peaceful solutions than as catalysts for war. The discussion addresses the influence of hegemonic values on shaping the roles of men, women, and attitudes toward war. The use of violence, intimidation, depersonalization, and denial of affect are also discussed. The social and clinical implications of the hegemonic and gender role factors on military escalation and peace activism are examined. The limitations of the study's subjects, instruments, and interpretations are presented. The study supports continued exploration of the concept of hegemonic values and their influence over gender roles and perpetuation of the war system.","","2022-10-06 19:18:02","2022-10-06 19:18:02","2022-10-06 19:18:02","","175","","","","","","","","","","California School of Professional Psychology - Los Angeles","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798206851021","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the academics have analysed its existence and described the operations with some implications. Dr Ambedkar had not only written on the issues of caste inequality but also fought against it in India, especially for the human rights of ex-untouchables known as Dalit?s. Therefore, it is imperative to understand his views on caste inequality which is structural in nature. As we know that, caste is a foundation of the society and it has manifested in social, economic, political and educational inequalities among various classes of the Indian society, especially caste Hindus. However, this article attempts to understand his views in the present context of growing caste inequality. In fact, there has not been much attention paid to his thought in the Indian academic world. This article also aims to enhance the understanding of caste inequality in the face of increasing global inequality of the world. In the present context, the economic gap between higher castes and lower castes is increasing in all the sphere of human life. There are changes in caste inequality at the superficial level, but there are no changes at the structural level of caste. Caste inequality has manifested in a worst form of discrimination and untouchability on the basis of birth. This article deliberates on the distinctive ideas of Dr Ambedkar on caste and its annihilation. We view this on the background of writings on caste by a selective sociologist. One needs no reiteration of the fact that caste is deeply rooted in Indian society and strengthened through various catalysts. Annihilation of caste besides analysing the origin, its perpetuation also connotes a reconstruction of Indian society based on the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity, which were the basic commitments of Dr Ambedkar and embedded in Buddhism as the egalitarian religion of India. Here we touch up on the interdisciplinary contributions of Dr Ambedkar through his analysis of caste, never ever carried forward significantly. Annihilation of caste was not for a single religion, it was for all as well since all are infected by the hierarchy, if not caste. It is established here that the ideas of Ambedkar on caste and its annihilation are worth revisiting, when the discourses on caste are taking their wayward path. The article is divided into two parts. First, it explores the ideas of Ambedkar on the mechanism, genesis and development of caste; and second, how other scholars have understood caste in order to understand Indian society at large. Dr Ambedkar was a protagonist of modern democratic principles such as justice, liberty and equality.","2020-06-01","2022-10-06 19:18:35","2022-10-06 19:18:35","2022-10-06 19:18:35","78-96","","1","6","","","Caste","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications India","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty years later, in 2006, a global resettlement programme was initiated to relocate them in eight different nations: the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, and the UK. Since 2010, about 350 Bhutanese refugees have been resettled in Greater Manchester through the Gateway Protection Programme. This thesis is based on 14 months of ethnographic research with members of this community. This thesis analyses the complex relationship between forced migrants, social networks, and ruling, organisational entities, which facilitate refugee resettlement. This qualitative study looks at the structure, role and everyday utility of social networks amongst a small refugee community, and emphasizes that the creation of similarity and difference is an inherent part of community development. The research calls into question the assumptions of UK policy makers, service providers and academics alike, which hold that refugees are removed from their ‘original’ cultures through forced displacement, and thereafter strive to return to a state of ‘normalcy’ or ‘originality’, re-creating and re-inventing singular ‘traditions’, identities and communities. In response to these assumptions, policy makers and service providers in refugee camps and in the UK adopt a Community Development Approach (CDA). However, I argue that there is no fixed and bounded community amongst Bhutanese refugees, but that they actively reshape and adapt their interpretations, meanings and actions through their experiences of forced migration, and thus create novel communities out of old and new social networks. In the process, I juxtapose my informants’ emic understandings of community as samaj, with bureaucratized refugee community organisations (RCOs). This research shows that rather than a creating singular, formalized RCO to serve the ‘good of all’, the Bhutanese refugee community in Manchester is rife with divisions based on personal animosities and events stretching back to the refugee camps in Nepal. I conclude that RCOs may not be equipped to effectively deal with the divisive issues that arise due to refugee resettlement. The thesis is situated at the centre of anthropological investigations of forced migration, community, and policy, and uses interdisciplinary sources (such as policy documents, historical accounts) to highlight the complexities of forced migration and refugee resettlement. This critical research is also a response to the call to make qualitative, ethnographic research more relevant for policy makers and service provision, which is all the more important in this ‘century of the refugee’.","2016","2022-10-06 19:18:56","2022-10-06 19:18:56","2022-10-06 19:18:56","","","","","","","Community in refugee resettlement","","","","","Brunel University London","","en","","Thesis","","","bura.brunel.ac.uk","","Accepted: 2017-05-08T13:41:00Z Journal Abbreviation: Community in refugee resettlement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  new situation has created a trend in IT outsourcing called offshoring. The term offshoring  refers to outsourcing to another country, commonly low-wage countries such as India or  China. The authors of this thesis were contacted in November 2006 by representatives of  our case-company and learned that they were interested in reviewing their IT offshoring  projects. The following questions were asked:  – What specific problems occur when working with offshoring projects?  – What factors are central for an efficient work-process in offshoring projects?  – How can the problems at the case-company office be dealt with?  Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to map out the problems and challenges that managers and  team members working with offshore projects face in their daily work and to make suggestions on how these  problems can be dealt with.  Perspective: The thesis is a case study of an IT-company and is therefore strongly tied to  the work-processes of the specific case-company. The focus is on IT outsourcing offshore  with its specific problems, such as non-collocated teams etc. Thus, it does not focus on the  common problems of working together in a team and problems with lack of good  management.  Method and Theory: The thesis is conducted with exploratory, hermeneutic and abductive  approaches. The primary data is collected from interviews with the personnel and the  secondary data is gathered from literature and journals. The thesis has been conducted with  focus on the factors discussed within the Offshore Project Success Model derived from  scholars Balaji and Ahuja.  Result, Analysis and Conclusion: When interviewing the personnel different aspects and  difficulties connected to offshore operations appeared, especially with the planning,  implementation and knowledge integration phase of the offshore resources. It seemed like  the process had been carried out without clearly defined targets and evaluations, which has  resulted in uncertainties at the management level considering the success-level of the  projects. The conclusion of the thesis focuses on three main problem areas, namely;  team/team communication, corporation/office communication and education and implementation support,  discussing the certain problems connected to these areas as well as presenting  recommendations for solving them.  Suggestions for further research: Cost-calculations and risk management connected to  offshore operations or a social study of the employees’ attitudes and reactions towards  offshore operations would be of interest.","2007-04-18","2022-10-06 19:19:34","2022-10-06 19:19:34","2022-10-06 19:19:34","","","","","","A case study of an IT-company","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","gupea.ub.gu.se","","Accepted: 2007-04-18T11:38:04Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The controlling question is whether national policy-making in the policy issue area of employment discrimination and affirmative action represents a validation of the pluralist/ethnic model's explanation of how African-Americans are politically and economically integrated on the national level. Relying on the theory of racial hierarchy and collectivism developed by Marguerite Barnett, theoretical and empirical material is presented in support of the hypothesis that the pluralist/ethnic model does not allow for an adequate explanation of the interactive political context involved in the 1991 CRA. Elite interviewing and other data-gathering techniques led me to the findings that race played a determinative and deleterious role in the 1991 CRA Phenomena, thus invalidating the pluralist/ethnic model. These findings highlight the need for policymakers to recognize that the application of the pluralist/ethnic model to African-Americans policy issues typically result in misconceived and disjointed public policy.","","2022-10-06 19:20:34","2022-10-06 19:20:34","2022-10-06 19:20:34","","377","","","","","The Civil Rights Act of 1991","","","","","University of Illinois at Chicago","United States -- Illinois","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798208930946","","","","","Social sciences; political integration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ethnographic material is adduced to demonstrate the striking correspondences between the rice cycle and the cycle of the human soul. Embedded in ideas and practices connected with the rice cycle is a hierarchical relationship between gods and humans, both of whom must play their parts in securing a good crop.

Inputs included financial and personnel resources. Employee characteristics examined include the social and career characteristics of personnel and their attitudes towards environmental protection. Employee characteristics were assessed through administration of a questionnaire to nonclerical personnel in the five agencies. Organizational arrangements subsumed structural variables such as degrees of hierarchy, jurisdictional scope, and departmental locus. Effectiveness was measured by changes over time in compliance of pollutors to agency abatement plans, air quality levels, and emission discharges. The results suggest, first of all, that air quality and emissions data are consistent dimensions but that compliance data behaves in a different manner. When defined in terms of air quality and emissions variables, effectiveness was found to be associated most predictably with financial resources, aggregate attitudes towards desirable levels of pollution, attitudes towards the intentions of industrial pollutors, and the jurisdictional scope of agencies. Other variables examined demonstrated surprisingly little connection with the performance of the air pollution control agencies.","","2022-10-06 19:20:51","2022-10-06 19:20:51","2022-10-06 19:20:51","","214","","","","","","","","","","Indiana University","United States -- Indiana","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798660813580","","","","","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It assesses five macrostructural theoretical models of health care: structural-functionalism, domination-deprivation, ecological, biological and racial inequality theories. The first three of these theories subsume race under the rubric of social class. The other two posit that race exerts direct effects on infant mortality independent of social class. Further, this research evaluates what impact variation between areas in eligibility standards and levels of support for redistributive health care programs have on infant mortality. Also, it examines whether increased availability of health care has a role in reducing infant mortality. Finally, it explores factors which effect racial disparities in infant mortalities. A sample of 235 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas in 1980 is used to test between the five theories and examine the impact of Medicaid and health care access on indices of infant mortality. The most notable finding is that socioeconomic deprivation has no impact on infant mortality rates when measures of racial inequality and racial composition are included in the regression equations. This is contrary to a long history of extant research. These findings lend support to racial inequality theory in comparison to the other theories examined. Further, there is modest support for the ameliorative effects of Medicaid policy and access to health care on infant mortality in 1980. A parallel cross-sectional analysis was performed for 1970. The findings did not change the empirical findings from the 1980 analysis. It did indicate that Medicaid policy had yet to impact infant mortality rates, although access to health care did lower these rates in 1970. The results of this research suggest that racial inequality resulting from patterns of institutional racism has a demonstrated impact on infant mortality rates as well as racial disparities in infant mortality. These findings suggest that further development of racial inequality theory is necessary. From a policy perspective, the findings question whether redistributive health care policies are effective in reducing rate of infant mortality rates, particularly for blacks. The same is true for indices of health access.","","2022-10-06 19:20:59","2022-10-06 19:20:59","2022-10-06 19:20:59","","206","","","","","The macrostructural determinants of health care delivery in the United States","","","","","State University of New York at Albany","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798207545172","","","","","Social sciences; Health and environmental sciences; infant mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Section V presents new evidence showing that cognitive and non-cognitive demands of work are related to the activities occupations actually require workers to perform and the more difficult jobs tend to be the most critical and prestigious. Section VI provides new evidence that educational requirements for  jobs can be explained largely by intelligence demands. Section VII presents a theory of naturally occurring occupational hierarchies. A review of the contributions of previous sections to a modified functional theory is followed by speculations about how occupational hierarchies arise in response to differences in intelligence in a population.

The reporting of Saturn's higher product quality was obtained from a well-known and trusted automobile rating agency. A survey instrument that combined Fons Trompenaars's (1994) culture questionnaire with an ad hoc survey of company training efforts written by me was administered on site. The Trompenaars instrument, the Culture and Organization Structure Questionnaire (COSQ), elicits an individual's preference on each of seven value orientations: collectivism, particularism (focusing on the uniqueness of situations versus universalism), integration (synthesis of information versus analysis of details), equality, ascription (status granted for reasons other than achievement), time (a long-term orientation and synchronicity, a nonsequential approach to time and tasks), and externality (locus of control). Preferences were revealed by the pattern of choices made when asked to resolve hypothetical workplace and situational dilemmas. The training survey solicited managers' ratings of the adequacy and effectiveness of typical efforts companies use to educate employees. Differences between the two auto plants emerged on collectivism, integration, equality, and externality, as predicted. The differences on particularism, ascription, and time were not statistically significantly different. Saturn managers, more than Wilmington plant managers, reported a collective, egalitarian, and integrative environment, while correlating its presence most strongly with extensive education efforts. In the older, more established Wilmington plant, mentoring was more strongly associated with the plant's sense of community. Furthermore, community was associated with Saturn's strong commitment to relationships with suppliers and customers. Implications for managing values in successful future organizations are presented.","","2022-10-06 19:21:46","2022-10-06 19:21:46","2022-10-06 19:21:45","","188","","","","","Organizational culture","","","","","California School of Professional Psychology - Berkeley/Alameda","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798691295515","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology; General Motors; Saturn","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A Theory of Labor Mobility with Applications to the Teacher Market","","","","","https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED095165","This report, the second in a series of eight which analyzes the educational personnel system, applies three theories of labor mobility to primary and secondary school teachers. These theories are the economic theory of the human capital model, the institutional theory of internal labor markets, and a probabilistic Markov model. The literature on each of the theories is briefly reviewed, and the substantive notions of the human capital model and the theory of internal labor markets are combined with the Markov model to develop a theory of teacher mobility. Some of the hypothetical implications of the theory of teacher mobility described are that: (a) interdistrict movement of school teachers should depend on both pecuniary and nonpecuniary differences among school districts; (b)  teachers who are located in assignments offering relatively low financial rewards should be more likely to leave teaching than those in more attractive assignments; (c) school districts should prefer to hire teachers who have more teaching experience and advanced degrees in education; and (d) relatively experienced teachers should be less mobile than less experienced teachers because they are more likely to be located in an assignment they consider attractive.

One promising recent development in the leadership literature focuses on the development and impact of informal leadership structures in a share leadership paradigm. Despite its theoretical importance, the network perspective of leadership emergence is still underdeveloped, largely due to the complexity of studying and theorizing about network-level phenomena. Using computational modeling techniques, I evaluate the network-level implications of two existing theories that broadly represent social theories of leadership emergence. I derive formal representations for both foundational theories and expand on this theory to develop a synthesis theory describing how these two processes work in parallel. Results from simulated experiments indicate that group homogeneity is associated with vastly different leadership network structures depending on which theoretical process mechanisms are in play. This thesis contributes significantly to the literature by 1) advancing a network-based approach to leadership emergence research, 2) testing the implications of existing theory, 3) developing new theory, and 4) providing a strong foundation and tool kit for future leadership network emergence research.","","2022-10-06 19:22:39","2022-10-06 19:22:39","2022-10-06 19:22:39","","139","","","","","Social Mechanisms of Leadership Emergence","","","","","Michigan State University","United States -- Michigan","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798664759846","","","","","Computational modeling; Social networks; Agent based modeling; Leadership emergence; Shared leadership; Formal models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How do producers make sense of their products’ value in a cultural field informed by structures of both art and commerce? How are categorization and evaluation related in cultural fields? How do these processes relate to broader systems of social inequality, such as those based on race, class and gender? In this dissertation, I analyze 120 in-depth interviews with critically recognized chefs and 1380 Michelin Guide restaurant reviews in New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area to examine the relationship between ethnoracial and gender inequality and cultural production in the context of American fine dining. I find that the system of ethnoracial categorization that defines the boundaries between restaurants and chefs in the field of American fine dining interacts with a system of three logics of evaluation that have different meanings and relevance to the assessment of distinct categories of cuisine in the field. This differential evaluation of different categories of cultural products and cultural producers then reproduces gender and ethnoracial hierarchies of culinary, artistic, and material value. I argue that chefs and restaurant critics use the logics of (1) technique, (2) creativity, and (3) authenticity to differentially evaluate restaurants and chefs serving (1) Classic, (2) Flexible, and (3) Ethnic cuisine, reflecting and reproducing a broader system of value that disproportionately celebrates culinary products and producers associated with whiteness and masculinity and devalues those actors that are symbolically or socially connected to femininity and /or non-whiteness.I find that Classic restaurants, that is, those restaurants serving French, Italian, and Japanese cuisine, occupy a prestigious position based on their historical association with formalized technique, culinary hegemony, and tradition. Classic restaurants are primarily and uniquely valued for their ability to replicate institutionalized techniques and shared traditions in fine dining. Restaurants and chefs serving unfamiliar Flexible cuisine types, such as “Contemporary,” American, and Californian cuisine, which lack shared meanings in the field are primarily valued for their artistic and scientific creativity, uniquely celebrated for the distinct contributions they make to the field through the production of personal, previously unknown cuisine. Finally, Ethnic restaurants are evaluated according to the logic of authenticity, which has inconsistent standards formed in relation to three reference points—(1) Classic and Flexible restaurants already recognized as legitimate in the fine dining field, (2) inexpensive, Americanized take out establishments, and (3) Ethnic home cooking. This differential system of evaluation then veils an insidious form of gender and racial bias in language focused on the technical, creative, and authentic merits of artistic and commercial products in an emerging, globalizing cultural field.","2018","2022-10-06 19:23:52","2022-10-06 19:23:52","2022-10-06 19:23:52","","","","","","","Discriminating Palates","","","","","UC Berkeley","","en","","","","","escholarship.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few studies have tested this assumption. This research draws on theories of control and coordination to investigate the relationship between control and information systems (IS) development performance. It consists of analyses of two research models, one at the individual level of analysis, and the other at the team level of analysis. The individual-level model investigates how control affects individual effort toward task and individual coordination success, and proposes that these relationships are moderated by controlees’ perceptions of how effectively a controller can monitor their work behaviors and outcomes. The team-level model investigates two mediators through which control may affect IS development performance: team effort toward task, and team coordination success. A field survey was conducted, and completed matched survey responses from 106 managers and team members involved in 36 different IS development projects were used to test the hypotheses. The results suggest that control does have a positive relationship with effort toward task and coordination success. Specifically, clan control was positively associated with coordination success at the individual and team levels, and with team effort toward task. Outcome control was positively associated with individual effort toward task. In addition, the relationship between outcome control and individual effort toward task was moderated by team member perceptions of the difficulty of observing outcomes. At high levels of difficulty of observing outcomes, high levels of outcome control resulted in higher effort than at low levels of difficulty of observing outcomes. Control was also positively related to performance outcomes. Behavior control was associated with reduced overruns of resources such as time, budget, and systems and programming effort. Outcome control was positively associated with product performance, which represents the quality, ease-of-use, and functionality of the system developed or enhanced by the project. Clan control was associated with both improved product performance and reduced resource overruns. No support was found for mediation of the effects of control on performance by effort toward task or coordination success.","","2022-10-06 19:25:20","2022-10-06 19:25:20","2022-10-06 19:25:20","","127","","","","","Control of information systems development","","","","","University of Pittsburgh","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781109493542","","","","","Social sciences; Coordination; Applied sciences; Control; Information systems development; IS development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior research has identified alliance management capability (AMC) as an important determinant for alliance success and three phases that can be distinguished in the life cycle of an alliance. A case study was conducted to identify what organizational elements constitute AMC in Dutch universities and which of these organizational elements are employed in different phases of the alliance life cycle. Additionally, general organizational elements that do not refer to specific phases of an alliance were investigated. This research provides two contributions to the AMC literature. First, this research focuses on AMC in universities, instead of commercial firms. Second, AMC is studied over three different phases in the alliance life cycle.   As general organizational elements almost all Dutch universities have departments and individual functions that are responsible for alliance related activities, however the alliance related activities and responsibilities are very much decentralized over different levels of the universities. Efforts to diffuse knowledge on alliance management are generally limited and focused on certain aspects.   For the first phase of the alliance life cycle, the alliance formation and partner selection, Dutch universities have organizational functions to facilitate in this phase. The networks of individuals in the universities are an important element in this phase. There is also a bilateral process of scouting internally for researchers that match projects externally and, searching for parties externally that match inventions and knowledge internally. Furthermore, various organizational tools are employed in this phase in the form of bibliometric analyses, trainings, documents and organizing days for external parties.  The second phase of the alliance life cycle, the governance and design, is also facilitated through organizational functions at different levels of the universities. Governance of collaborations is discussed at different levels of the universities. The universities use tools in the form of documents containing guidelines and rules about contracts, intellectual property (IP) and to take into account the academic interests of the universities.  Most of the Dutch universities also have organizational functions that are involved in the postformation alliance management, the third phase of alliance life cycle. The involvement of these functions consists mainly of providing support to the researchers. Functions involved in alliance related activities also expressed the fragility of managing ongoing alliances at the universities.","2012","2022-10-06 19:25:44","2022-10-06 19:25:44","2022-10-06 19:25:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","CC-BY-NC-ND","Master Thesis","","","studenttheses.uu.nl","","Accepted: 2012-10-25T17:01:42Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"H6J98832","preprint","2010","Frank, Aaron","Military Revolutions, Evolution, and International Relations Theory","","","","","https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1643510","Military revolutions constitute a significant challenge to international relations theorists. The combination of changes in military technology, organization, and operational concepts has collectively altered the structure and composition of international systems. These changes go beyond the classical concerns for the dynamics of the international system or the diffusion of weapons technology, which emphasize shifts in the balance of power between states, to concerns over the particular states themselves, affecting the boundaries within and between them. Changes of the kind characterized by military revolutions have been a significant focus of military historians and others focused on the formation and dissolution of states, but explaining their occurrence remains a theoretical challenge to international relations theorists who maintain strong ontological commitments to the state as a discrete unit of analysis. As a result, international relations theorists have largely worked within conceptual frameworks that are inadequate for investigating phenomenon that contain cross-scale linkages, such as those that link tactical military innovation with alterations of the balance-of-power in the international system, or event those innovations that call the unity of the state into question. In order address the shortcomings of international relations theories, this paper examines how concepts and models from evolutionary theory might be applied to the study of military innovation, marking an initial attempt to identify aspects of evolutionary theory that may be suitable for application to international relations. In doing so, it explores neorealism and it’s compatibility with evolutionary theory. While neorealism does not represent the universe of international relations theory, it does serve as the foundation from which almost all studies depart and therefore sits at the core of the discipline. Section 1, characterizes military revolutions as defined by various military historians, and motivates the turn towards evolutionary theory. Section 2 examines evolutionary theory, and discusses the differences between micro and macroevolution. Section 3 uses two leading neorealist texts in order to examine their approaches to the international system as a system of actors, and the forces they exert upon one another. Finally, Section 4 compares the neorealist treatment of the international system with requirements of evolutionary theory in order find areas of agreement, disagreement, and requirements for continued theoretical development.","2010","2022-10-06 19:28:13","2022-10-06 19:28:13","2022-10-06 19:28:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","evolution; coevolution; military revolutions; neorealism; punctuated equilibrium; revlution in military affairs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1643510","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the film, Earth moves outward to distant planets in order to satisfy its resource hunger. In their search, Earthlings arrive on Pandora, a biologically rich planet with a diverse and complex ecosystem. In defence of their home planet, the Indigenous people of Pandora (the Na'vi) engage in combat with the earthlings over which aspect of the planet is more important: the life above or the resources below. The environmental message in Avatar is one which promotes balance and harmony between humans and nature. However, this balance is represented by the film’s essentialized Indigenous population. Thus, as a foil for Earth's technology-dependent resource-intensive society, the Na'vi are represented as a stereotypical Indigenous population; they are cast as closer to nature in their role as the ""ecological Indian."" By using archaic portrayals of Indigenous peoples, the film uses an ""Indigenous"" voice to propel its environmental message.

This classic of functionalist social anthropology is particularly interesting because it describes a deeply divided and unequal modern society. In the American South, the population was divided into two endogamous ‘castes’ and segregation ensured their almost complete social separation, with whites dominant over blacks. Each racial group was also divided by class, so that Natchez society was based on an elaborate caste-class hierarchy, whose characteristics are subtly explored in Deep South. None the less, although the caste concept was used by other American writers, most later social scientists preferred ‘ethnic group’ or ‘race’ itself. Caste in India has been compared with American racial caste, but anthropologists of India have scarcely exploited the insights to be derived from Deep South and similar studies. For understanding the institutions and values of hierarchy, Deep South remains invaluable.

Chaque groupe social était aussi divisé en classes, de sorte que la société de Natchez se fondait sur une complexe hiérarchie de caste et de classe dont Deep South explore subtilement les caractéristiques. Ceci étant dit, bien que d'autres auteurs américains aient aussi utilisé la notion de caste, la plupart des sociologues postérieurs ont préféré« groupe ethnique » ou « race ». Les castes indiennes ont été comparées aux castes raciales américaines, mais les anthropologues travaillant sur l'Inde ont très peu exploité l'éclairage que pouvaient apporter Deep South et d'autres études similaires. Or Deep South reste inestimable lorsqu'il s'agit de comprendre les institutions et les valeurs de la hiérarchie.","2011","2022-10-06 19:33:37","2022-10-06 19:33:37","2022-10-06 19:33:37","604-621","","3","17","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9655.2011.01709.x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"UEP6G623","thesis","","Gam, Beverley","The Role of the Family System in the Rehabilitation Process of Substance Abuse","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2570143530/abstract/E16BACCCBA6848DAPQ/1","According to Edmonds and Wilcocks (1995:1-2), South Africa is in the grip of a major drug boom. If this is not taken seriously, South Africa could lose as much as 30% of its future generation in terms of health, happiness, functioning and even life. Drug abuse is an important factor that can affect the quality of life of not only the drug abuser, but also all those connected with them (Edmonds and Wilcocks, 1995:1-2). Substance abuse is a problem that influences the family system. Models such as Bell and Khantzian (1991) and Cooks' (1988) description of the Minnesota model define substance abuse as a disease. This model also known as the medical model, can be attributed to the work of Jellinek (1960). It focuses on individual biological factors with little consideration for familial, social or psychological variables. On the other hand, a family systems perspective indicates that the family system enables the substance abuser towards abusive patterns of behaviour. The family plays an important role in the process of dependency as well as in the rehabilitation process. These models are brought together in the study, as this combination is valuable in understanding the complexity of substance abuse and its effects on the family system. The aim of the study is to explore the families understanding of substance abuse and their role in the treatment process. A qualitative methodology is used to understand the life events, experiences and beliefs of family members, from their point of view. The focus of the research is on family members who have attended the family program at Stepping Stones Rehabilitation Center. Exploring the understanding they have of substance abuse and their role in the treatment process, from their frame of reference. The theoretical basis for the study is formulated within the medical model and a systems perspective. A nonprobability, purposive sample is utilized to seek information rich cases. Eleven respondents are interviewed. Different members within the family system are selected to illuminate the question under investigation. An interview schedule formulated from literature, is utilized to create consistency in the face-to-face interviews. The in depth interviews facilitate exploration. Data is gathered by means of a literature review, field notes and audiotapes transcribed by the researcher. Analysis of the data is done manually according to a schedule. The schedule I developed according to coding categories that are identified when working with raw data. The information from the data gathered is analysed and used to identify themes, which are offered as results. An extensive literature control is conducted, in order to further the validity of the research. From the study, methodological and theoretical conclusions can be made. Methodological conclusions indicate the effectiveness of using a qualitative methodology and face-to-face interviews in exploring the question under study. The theoretical conclusions indicate families understanding of substance abuse and their role in the treatment process. Recommendations in terms of intervention with families affected by substance abuse and future research, are drawn from the research process and context of the study ensure the link between results and conclusions and aims and objectives. Alternate abstract: Substansafhanklikheid is 'n maatskaplike probleem wat die gesinsisteem as geheel aanspreek. Intervensies wat daarop gerig is om die afhanklikheid aan te spreek, word vanuit 'n sistemiese denkrigting ontwikkel. Die verandering van die individu deur middel van sistemiese intervensies, impliseer dan ook dat die gesinsisteem deur 'n proses van verandering en ondersteuning gelei behoort te word. Verskeie modelle spreek die behandeling van die substansafhanklikheid deur middel van gesinsintervensie aan. Die belangrikste beginsel in hierdie modelle is die gesin se rol in die instandhouding van die problematiek. Hierdie studie fokus op die gesinsisteem se begrip van die rehabilitasie- en behandelingsproses. Die gesin se siening van die rol in instandhouding van die substansafhanklikheid word ook ondersoek. Die studie maak gebruik van kwalitatiewe metodologie om die lewenservaringe, perspektiewe en ondervindinge aangaande die substansafhaklikheid te beskryf. 'n Literatuurstudie ten opsigte van die integrering van die mediese model en die sistemiese modelle word gedoen ten einde die raamwerk te skep vir die ontwikketing van die datainsamelings-instrumente. Die data is ingesamel aan die hand van indiepte onderhoude. Die onderhoudskedule is gebruik ten einde die onderhoude te struktureer en eenvormigheid te verhoog. Die data is vasgete deur middel van audiokassette en veldnotas. Die data is sistematies ge-analiseer aan die hand van kategorisering en 'n proses van kodering is gevolg ten einde bepaalde temas te formuleer. Die temas het gelei tot metodologiese en teoretiese gevolgtrekkinge. Die gevolgtrekkings het gelei tot die maak van aanbevelings ten opsigte van praktyktoepassings.","","2022-10-06 19:33:53","2022-10-06 19:33:53","2022-10-06 19:33:53","","136","","","","","","","","","","University of Johannesburg (South Africa)","South Africa","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798744420994","","","","","Behavior; Social psychology; Knowledge; Qualitative research; System theory; Medical research; Influence; Data analysis; Causality; African literature; Data collection; Individual & family studies; Literature; Research methodology; Families & family life; Objectives; Addictive behaviors; Alcoholism; Divorce; Domestic violence; Drug abuse; Drug addiction; Drug use; Mental disorders; Narcotics; Pharmaceutical sciences; Principles; Substance abuse treatment; Support groups","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Practitioners have long maintained that a full spectrum combined-arms military is the best defense in an unpredictable and anarchic international environment. Yet capable states often either forgo some vital defense capabilities, like the US omitting minesweepers from its planned 600 ship navy in the 1980s, or overproduce some defense capabilities, like Albania developing coastal patrol vessels with a range of 1,750 miles despite having a coastline that is roughly one tenth that size. Are states with seemingly inefficient militaries simply making mistakes? I argue that vulnerable force structures are not just the result of poor planning or resource constraints; rather, these observed “inefficiencies” are often a strategically motivated decision to specialize one’s force structure. While there are certainly advantages to a diversified military portfolio, states can engage in strategically motivated functional differentiation by specializing their militaries when they engage in cooperative security alignments. When a collection of states facing a similar threat environment are able to minimize the risk of defection and ensure effective coordination, they can engage in a division of labor where each state individually specializes in different military capabilities that, when brought together, still comprise a full spectrum military force. I substantiate these arguments with evidence from a new dataset on the distribution of military capabilities from 1970-2020 and find that 1) states in cooperative security alignments have more specialized militaries, and 2) cooperative security alignments with more closely aligned interests and higher vertical integration have a higher division of labor.","2021","2022-10-06 19:34:02","2022-10-06 19:34:02","2022-10-06 19:34:02","","143","","","","","Use Their Force","","","","","University of California, San Diego","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798759994657","","","","","Alliances; International conflict; International security; Military technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, clear evidence of this beneficial influence is lacking. In fact, few studies have examined between-group differences in the degree of status hierarchy (defined as within-group variation in individual status) and how they are related to bullying, a widespread form of aggression in schools. Data from 11,296 eighth- and ninth-graders (mean age = 14.57, 50.6 % female) from 583 classes in 71 schools were used to determine the direction of the association between classroom degree of status hierarchy and bullying behaviors, and to investigate prospective relationships between these two variables over a 6-month period. Multilevel structural equation modeling analyses showed that higher levels of classroom status hierarchy were concurrently associated with higher levels of bullying at the end of the school year. Higher hierarchy in the middle of the school year predicted higher bullying later in the year. No evidence was found to indicate that initial bullying predicted future hierarchy. These findings highlight the importance of a shared balance of power in the classroom for the prevention of bullying among adolescents.","2014-07-01","2022-10-06 19:34:16","2022-10-06 19:34:16","2022-10-06 19:34:16","1123-1133","","7","43","","J Youth Adolescence","Inequality Matters","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Popularity; Bullying; Multilevel structural equation modeling; Status hierarchy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"5BF9ZMRQ","conferencePaper","2005","Genna, Gaspara M.","""Public Perceptions of the European Power Hierarchy and Support for a Common Foreign and Security Policy""","","","","","http://aei.pitt.edu/3124/","Prior research on citizen support for European integration has primarily focused on individuals’ evaluations of the process of integration or its institutions, with emphasis on the importance of direct benefits and costs integration can confer. Explanations focus on overall support for integration and little work has been done on explaining public opinion on specific policy areas, such as the development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Prior work also does not consider individuals’ evaluations of member states in models. This paper will fill this gap in the research by formulating and testing a political cohesion model, which can be considered complementary to preexisting models. The analysis synthesizes systems theory with social identity theory to produce a core claim that the probability of supporting the CFSP increases with greater levels of political trust in the European Union member-states. The development of political cohesion, as measured by the amount of trust in member-states, is assumed to be reflective of a positive perception. Positive perceptions of member-states are critical because integration’s development is influenced strongly by and dependent upon the resources of the relatively more powerful European member-states. Therefore, positive perceptions of the top EU powers, namely Germany and France, improve the probability of supporting a CFSP, more so than trusting the remaining members. The results hold even when controlling for demographic variables, political values, ideology, and the democratic deficit. Binary logistic regression analysis using pooled repeated cross-sectional data from the Eurobarometer surveys conducted in 1992 through 1997 among individuals of 11 member-states largely support these claims.","2005","2022-10-06 19:36:14","2022-10-06 19:36:23","2022-10-06 19:36:14","","","","","","","","","","","","","Austin, Texas","","","","","","","","Pages: 37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This dissertation builds on recent midwestern and southern lesbian and gay scholarship outside of major cities by moving beyond the traditional narratives of homonormativity and metronormativity that place coastal metropoles like New York and San Francisco at the center of lesbian and gay politics and activism. Oftentimes, places like southwest Missouri have been glossed over or completely erased as potential centers of gay and lesbian community building and political activism. In order to combat such erasure, this dissertation is situated within a context where people travelled between the rural hinterland and semi-urban landscapes. While the New Christian Right had a stronghold in the “buckle of the biblebelt,” the region’s lesbian and gay population pushed back in several ways. They formed service organizations, created new ways to traverse the sexual landscape, and met outspoken critics of homosexuality with equally fiery resistance. Ultimately, I show how lesbians and gays in southwest Missouri developed a sense of belonging in the communities in which they lived in order to navigate complicated relationships in their lives, extreme loss during the AIDS crisis, and their engagement with an ongoing public debate over the morality of homosexuality.","2019","2022-10-06 19:36:35","2022-10-06 19:36:35","2022-10-06 19:36:35","","312","","","","","Lesbian and Gay Life in the Queen City and Beyond","","","","","State University of New York at Buffalo","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781687943088 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","","","","","Gay; Lesbian; Missouri; Ozarks; Rural South; Sexuality; United States history","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was not a religious analysis on the value of Islam nor did it place a value judgment on Islam as a religion; rather, this study utilized a management systems perspective to analyze how Islamic Law provides organizational and management guidance for Islamic terrorist organizations conducting their world war against non-Muslim states and especially against the United States. Because Islamic Law (Shari'a) governs all aspects of Muslims' lives, it was a reasonable assumption that Shari'a provides guidance for terrorists' actions. The study identified the organizational and management attributes embedded in Islamic Law by focusing on a textual analysis of the Qur'an 1 and selected supporting texts. The evidence that an organizational and management structure is embedded within Islamic Law indicates that taking a comprehensive systems approach to understand Islamic terrorism could inform the national debate on how to better understand this phenomenon, add to the body of knowledge regarding the relationship of religious beliefs and management practices, and possibly provide insight that could lead to the defeat of Islamic terrorists.

I argue that the forms of dependency that Lithuania has traditionally been engaged in are changing and diversifying as the political and economic landscape of Europe has been changing since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Contrariwise, during the rule of the Soviet Union, Lithuania's dependency was geared towards Moscow. This dissertation will illustrate that Lithuania is in a condition of ""multi-dependency,"" being dependent ultimately on access to various resources provided by the United States, European Union, and Russia.","","2022-10-06 19:37:51","2022-10-06 19:37:51","2022-10-06 19:37:51","","237","","","","","Multi-dependency in the post-socialist period","","","","","University of California, Riverside","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780542598937","","","","","Social sciences; Globalization; Political economy; Dependency; Lithuania; Postsocialist","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the application of gender as a mode of analysis illustrates that a division existed amongst the working-class seamen in their vision of what it meant to be a worker, specifically a maritime worker. These differing ideas of masculinity drove a wedge between the seamen of the British Royal Navy, thus weakening their class solidarity. One faction of seamen favored the existing social contract accepted a society based on inequality, even amongst men, but in return demanded that their contributions as workers and as men be acknowledged by their rulers through both material and symbolic rewards. Similarly, another element of the seamen sought a more revolutionary solution in seeking rewards for their masculine contributions, which included acknowledgement of their roles as workers and rights as men through political equality. What it meant to be a seaman and the contestation of that definition motivated and limited the historical agency of seamen in the greatest labor dispute during the Age of Sail: the British seamen's Spithead and Nore mutinies of 1797.

"3T8WIEAQ","thesis","","Engel, Paul G. H.","Facilitating Innovation: An Action-Oriented Approach and Participatory Methodology to Improve Innovative Social Practice in Agriculture","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2497340209/abstract/54B271455CE24B34PQ/1","This study focuses upon the social organization of innovation. It makes use of insights from knowledge and information systems research, development sociology, management science and applied philosophy and seeks answers to the following questions: What do social actors, individuals and/or organizations, actually do to innovate their practices? How do they organize themselves? Can this be managed or facilitated, and if so, how? The research is exploratory rather than conclusion-oriented and synthesizes the results of over 50 case studies of agricultural innovation in 15 different countries, including the Netherlands. Its main results are a conceptualization of innovation as a social process and a participatory action-research methodology to enhance innovative performance. The methodology is based on soft systems thinking and offers a variety of 'windows' or analytical perspectives to help social actors analyze the way they are organized for innovation in an action-oriented fashion. The methodology has been field-tested in 15 areas in 7 different countries. The author proposes that agricultural innovation can be looked at as resulting from the interplay between social actors representing relevant social practices. Social practices relevant to agricultural innovation include farming, research, extension, education, agroindustrial processing, marketing, mass media communication, policy-making, product quality control and the development, production, certification and distribution of inputs. Innovation then is a diffuse, social process of both individual and collective inquiry into intentions, alternative solutions and enabling and constraining conditions which leads to new or modified problem definitions and practical choices of solutions. The organization and quality of these inquiries eventually determine innovative performance at a certain point in time. What social actors actually do to innovate their practices can be understood as networking: social actors in search of relevant ideas, knowledge, information and experiences, continuously build and manage relationships with others which, by some standard, they consider relevant to innovating their practices. As a result of networking, over time forms of social organization of innovation emerge. These reflect dynamics of their own and are not fully describable or explicable in terms of micro-events. The author proposes four such emergent forms to be relevant to students of complex innovation theatres: Convergences emerge when social actors narrow down the scope of their arguments and the range of issues and alternative scenarios they consider relevant to innovating their practices. Resource coalitions emerge when social actors decide to pool their resources in a joint performance. Communication networks emerge as a direct consequence of social actors' decisions to create joint learning opportunities and to produce and exchange information among themselves. Over time, where the above forms coincide, a pattern of more or less durable relationships between a limited set of social actors, an innovation configuration, may emerge. In such a configuration strategic consensus, a clear definition of tasks and responsibilities and a rational allocation of resources among social actors is possible. It also appears that each of these forms, but particularly the last one, may demonstrate inertia when faced with rapidly changing demands and/or circumstances. As a result, innovative performance may drop. To enable social actors to assess their current way of organizing for innovation, a participatory action-research methodology is proposed: RAAKS, Rapid or Relaxed Appraisal of Agricultural Knowledge Systems. Its design is based upon 'soft knowledge systems thinking', combining the philosophy and guiding principles of soft systems methodology with analytical instruments from knowledge systems research. Through active participation of relevant social actors, RAAKS aims at a threefold objective: to raise awareness and understanding, to probe new alliances and to formulate proposals for action. It guides participants through an accumulative, interactive learning process leading from problem appraisal, via a joint inquiry towards the definition of potentially useful actions and/or interventions. In recognition of the appreciative character of innovation and its social organization, RAAKS offers a choice of perspectives or 'windows' to help stakeholders recognize, organize and debate relevant ideas and events. The conceptual approach mentioned above supports the integration of the findings into a more comprehensive understanding of the social organization of innovation in each particular case. RAAKS has been field-tested over a dozen times in the Netherlands and in six countries in Central America. These experiences confirmed its relevance and applicability as a methodology, as well as its adaptability to particular demands and circumstances. RAAKS proved most useful in situations where, often ill-defined, feelings of unease persist among relevant stakeholders about the course innovation takes or its pace. It has proved useful in training (future) extension and research managers, and helping them to understand the context in which they operate. RAAKS also demonstrated its usefulness to those organizations or individuals who sell or provide 'knowledge/information intensive' products or services, such as research, extension and advisory services. It provides them with an instrument to appreciate the dynamic social context in which their products or services have to be marketed and are to prove themselves. Finally, due to its participatory character and soft systems design, RAAKS seems a promising instrument to help social actors organize themselves to deal with complex societal problems, which require higher levels of effective cooperation among stakeholders, such as natural resource management, regional development, stopping environmental degradation or waste disposal. Several experiences with RAAKS outside agriculture illustrate that its relevance to facilitating complex innovation processes is not limited to agricultural development as such. As a general conclusion, the study points at the need to amplify research on knowledge management. To facilitate knowing between agencies and organizations, interorganizational communication, whether direct or indirect, joint learning, sense making and resource pooling would have to become objects of study and eventually of (knowledge) management. Also, networking would have to be studied, its adequacy, effectiveness and efficiency in specific situations assessed and improvements designed and evaluated. The author argues that the challenge for management sciences with respect to social organization of innovation is to achieve a balance between direction and control on the one hand, and the creation and maintenance of space for serendipitous and epiphenomenal improvements on the other. In addition, he proposes RAAKS may contribute not only to facilitating innovative social practice directly, but to scientific inquiry as well. For such a purpose, its potential and limitations do need to be further evaluated. In general, he suggests, soft (knowledge) systems thinking receives far less attention from the research community than it deserves. Alternate abstract: Deze Studie rieht zich op de sociale organisatie van innovatieprocessen. Zij bouwt voort op inzichten uit het onderzoek naar kennis- en informatiesystemen, de ontwikkelingssociologie, de bedrijfskunde en de toegepaste filosofie en zoekt een antwoord op de volgende wagen: Wat doen sociale actoren, Individuen dan wel organisaties, eigenlijk om hun praktijken te vernieuwen? Hoe organiseren zij zichzelf daarvoor? En kan er iets aan gedaan worden om dit te managen of te faciliteren, en zo ja, hoe? Het onderzoek is niet conclusie-gericht maar exploratief. Het beoogt voor praktijk en wetenschap nuttige, nieuwe inzichten op te doen. Meer dan vijftig case studies betreffende de sociale organisatie van landbouwkundige vernieuwing in vijftien verschillende landen, waaronder Nederland, vormen de empirische basis voor het onderzoek. De belangrijkste resultaten zijn een aanzet tot theorievorming rond innovatie als sociaal procès en een aanpak voor parüeipatief actie-onderzoek gericht op het bevorderen van het gemeenschappelijk innoverend vermögen van sociale actoren. De aanpak is gebaseerd op 'zacht systeem denken' en biedt diverse 'vensters' of analytische perspectieven aan, waarmee de actoren zelf de wijze waarop zij zieh organiseren om te innoveren op een actie-gerichte wijze kunnen onderzoeken en beoordelen. Zij is op vijftien plaatsen in zeven verschillende landen uitgetest door middel van veldonderzoek. Voorgesteld wordt landbouwkundige innovatie te zien als de résultante van sociale interactie hissen actoren die afkomstig zijn uit verschillende relevante sociale praktijken. Zulke relevante praktijken kunnen bijvoorbeeld zijn: het voeren van een landbouwbedrijf, het doen van onderzoek, het geven van voorlichting of onderwijs, de agro-industriële verwerking of vermarkting van landbouwprodukten, het maken van radio of televisieprogramma's ten aanzien van de landbouw, maar ook kwaliteitscontrole en de ontwikkeling, produktie, distributie en certificatie van inputs. Innovatie kan dan begrepen worden als een diffuus, sociaal procès waarbinnen het individuele en collectieve zoeken naar en onderzoeken van intenties, alternatieve oplossingen en bevorderende dan wel beperkende factoren leidt tot nieuw zieht op de problematiek en tot praktische keuzen voor bepaalde concrète oplossingen. De wijze waarop deze zoekprocessen zijn georganiseerd, en hun kwaliteit, bepalen dan uiteindelijk hoe het innovatieproces verloopt en wat het resultaat zal zijn. Wat sociale actoren nu eigenlijk doen om hun praktijken te vernieuwen, kan worden geduid met de term netwerken: op zoek naar relevante ideeen, kennis en informatie, bouwen actoren continu aan relaties met anderen die zij, om de één of andere reden, relevant vinden voor hun streven naar innovatie. Als gevolg van dit netwerken ontstaan met de tijd speeifieke vormen van sociale organisatie voor innovatie. Deze vertonen een eigen dynamiek en zijn niet volledig te beschrijven of uit te leggen vanuit de gebeurtenissen op microniveau. De auteur stelt voor dat vier van dergelijke sociale organisatievormen van belang zijn voor diegenen die complexe innovatietheaters willen onderzoeken: convergenties treden op wanneer sociale actoren de 'bandbreedte' in hun argumentatie vernauwen, de onderwerpen afbakenen en de alternatieve oplossingen die (nog) worden onderzocht beperken; coalities rond leidinggevende actoren zien we optreden wanneer sociale actoren besluiten hun middelen samen te voegen teneinde een bepaald soort vernieuwingen een kans te geven; en communicatienetwerken ontstaan als directe consequentie van de besluiten die actoren nemen om gemeenschappelijke leerervaringen te creeren en om informatie te produceren en onderling uit te wisselen. Naarmate de tijd voortschrijdt en als bovengenoemde vormen meer en meer gaan samenvallen, kan tussen een beperkt aantal actoren een patroon van min of meer duurzame relaties ontstaan, een innovatieconfiguratie. In zo'n configuratie is tassen de deelnemende actoren overeenstemming mogelijk met betrekking tot strategische doelen, een duidelijke definitie van taken en verantwoordelijkheden en een rationele allocatie van middelen. Het lijkt zo, dat elk van de genoemde vormen, maar in het bijzonder de configuraties, traagheid vertonen wanneer zij geconfronteerd worden met snel veranderende eisen en/of omstandigheden. Dit kan een negatieve uitwerking hebben op de mate waarin door de betrokkenen geinnoveerd wordt en op de relevantie van het soort innovaties dat wordt gerealiseerd. Om sociale actoren te ondersteunen in het onderzoeken en beoordelen van de wijze waarop zij zieh hebben georganiseerd om te innoveren, wordt een participatieve actieonderzoeksaanpak voorgesteld: RAAKS (Rapid of Relaxed Appraisal of Agricultural Knowledge Systems). Het ontwerp van deze aanpak is gebaseerd op 'zacht kennissysteem denken', een combinatie van de filosofie en principes van de zachte systeemhenadering met analytisch instrumenten uit het kennissysteemonderzoek. Door middel van actieve participatie van de betrokkenen zelf probeert RAAKS drie elkaar aanvullende doelstellingen te veroezenlijken: de aandacht voor en het begrip van de sociale organisatie van innovatie te vergroten, nieuwe vormen van communicatie en samenwerking tussen de actoren af te tasten en tot formulering van concrete actie-voorstellen te komen. RAAKS gidst de deelnemers als het ware door een interactief, accumulatief leerproces leidend van een heroverweging van de geformuleerde problemen, via een gezamenlijk onderzoek van de sociale organisatie voor innovatie, naar een definitie van mogelijk zinvolle acties en/of interventies. Gezien het appreciatieve karakter van innovatie en de sociale organisatie eromheen, biedt RAAKS de deelnemers een mime keuze van 'windows' of onderzoeksperspectieven aan die hen kunnen helpen relevante ideeen en gebeurtenissen te onderkennen, te structureren en te bespreken. De theoretische benadering die hierboven is uiteengezet helpt de groep erbij op grond van haar bevindingen voor zichzelf een vollediger beeld te scheppen van de sociale organisatie van innovatie in ieder specifiek geval. RAAKS is vijftien maal uitgetest in veldsituaties, in Nederland en in zes landen in Midden-Amerika. Deze ervaringen bevestigden de relevantie en toepasbaarheid van de aanpak, alsook de mogelijkheid haar aan te passen aan specifieke eisen en omstandigheden. RAAKS bleek vooral zinvol in situaties waar belangrijke actoren, vaak siecht omschreven gevoelens van onbehagen koesterden met betrekking tot de koers die innovatieprocessen namen of de snelheid waarmee innovaties werden gerealiseerd. Zij is bruikbaar gebleken in de training van (toekomstige) managers van voorlichtings- en onderzoeksinstimten. Zij leerden hierdoor de context van sociale relaties waarbinnen zij dienen te opereren beter kennen en begrijpen. RAAKS bleek ook nuttig voor organisaties of individuen die 'kennis/informatie-intensieve' produkten of diensten verkopen dan wel leveren, zoals onderzoeksinstellingen, voorlichtings- en adviesbureau's. De aanpak geeft hen een instrumentarium om de dynamische sociale context waarbinnen hun produkten of diensten afgezet dienen te worden en een toegevoegde waarde dienen te realiseren op waarde te schatten. Vanwege haar zachte systeem ontwerp en participatieve opzet tensiotte lijkt RAAKS een veelbelovende aanpak om sociale actoren te ondersteunen bij het zieh organiseren om complexe maatschappelijke problemen aan te pakken die hogere niveaus van samenwerking vereisen, zoals het management van namurlijke hulpbronnen, regionale ontwikkeling, het stoppen van milieu-degradatie of het verwerken/afvoeren van afVal. Verschillende ervaringen met RAAKS buiten de landbouw hebben ge'fllustreerd dat de relevantie ervan voor het faciliteren van complexe innovatieprocessen niet beperkt is tot landbouwontwikkeling als zodanig. Als algemene conclusie wordt gesteld dat het onderzoek naar kennismanagement uitbreiding behoeft. Om het kennen, als eenheid van leren en doen, tussen organisaties te bevorderen dienen de communicatie tussen organisaties, of die nu direct is of indirect, het gemeenschappelijk leren en zingeven aan ideeën en gebeurtenissen en het bundelen van middelen voor innovatiedoeleinden onderwerp van onderzoek en uiteindelijk van (kennis) management te worden. Zo ook zou het netwerken zelf grondiger moeten worden besmdeerd, zodat de zin, effectiviteit en efficiëntie ervan in specifîeke situaties nauwkeuriger kan worden vastgesteld en verbeteringen kunnen worden ontworpen en geëvalueerd. De auteur stelt dat de uitdaging die de sociale organisatie van innovatieprocessen stelt aan de managementwetenschappen is een balans te vinden mssen aan de ene kant sturing en contrôle en aan de andere kant het creëren en het behouden van ruimte voor onbedoelde en onverwachte verbeteringen, die ontstaan uit een min of meer toevallige samenloop van handelingen en omstandigheden. Daarnaast oppert de auteur de mogelijkheid dat RAAKS niet alleen bruikbaar is voor het faciliteren van de innovatieve sociale praktijk, maar ook als aanpak voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek. Daarvoor dienen echter haar mogelijkheden en beperkingen nader te worden onderzocht. De onderzoeksgemeenschap, stelt hij, besteedt in het algemeen veel minder aandacht aan de zachte (kennis)systeemleer dan deze verdient.","","2022-10-06 19:39:31","2022-10-06 19:39:31","2022-10-06 19:39:31","","318","","","","","Facilitating Innovation","","","","","Wageningen University and Research","Netherlands","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798569956838","","","","","Agricultural innovation; Social construction of innovation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this thesis, we chose to develop on other aspects that can have an impact on aid projects and their success. These aspects include organisational structures, namely hierarchical and flat organisations, and the impact that they can have on organisational learning. This thesis is based on a nine week long case study within the Healthy Hospital project. The project has for the last three years been focused on improving the standards and facilities of Kolandoto Hospital in Tanzania, by technical and architectural solutions. As part of the selected Participatory Action Research-methodology, we were involved in a procurement process as well as conducting evaluations through interviews. The interviews were focused on the project and learning outcomes of installations and subprojects, done within the Healthy Hospital project. Three parties were identified within the Healthy Hospital project; The hospital, the project group and the master thesis students. Out of these three, the organisational structure was investigated for the hospital and the project group. In the end, learning outcomes and processes were analysed as well as the impact on these from the different organisational structures. Consequences on organisational learning could often be linked to either the hierarchical structure of the hospital or the nonhierarchical structure of the project group. To conclude the thesis, recommendations for the project group were provided to enable further organisational learning within the Healthy Hospital project. The main recommendation for the project group is to further formalize the communication with the students as well as creating safe spaces for the hospital to enable feedback.","2017","2022-10-06 19:39:41","2022-10-06 19:39:54","2022-10-06 19:39:41","","","","","","","How Organisational Learning is created in an aid project","","","","","","","eng","","","","","odr.chalmers.se","","Accepted: 2019-07-03T14:41:11Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, accounting firms are structured hierarchically, as certain levels of education are requisite to be able to eventually sign the Financial Statement. Millennials, the generation born between 1980 and 2000, are joining the workplace, but expect different power dynamics than previous generations. They expect to be valued for their knowledge, instead of their place in the hierarchy. This study investigated what role both forces, knowledge and hierarchy, play in the decision-making processes in the accounting sector. The data for this research was gathered by conducting semi-structured interviews and observer participant observations.    The expectation for the outcome of this research was that expert power plays a positive role in the decision-making processes, and hierarchy plays a negative role in the decision-making processes. Moreover, expected was that expert power and hierarchy would show a strong cohesion. The findings of this research showed that both hierarchy and expert power play a role in the decision-making process at the accounting department at Bol Adviseurs. There is found a strong convergent relationship between the two power bases. However, in the end, expert power is never more important than hierarchy in the decision-making process.     This research contributed to expert power and hierarchy theory in the context of accounting firms, firstly by showing that the hierarchy is found inherent to the profession and accepted by all generations. Therefore, young professionals do not find hierarchy difficult to understand in all contexts, as was stated by Schawbel (2012). Secondly, expert power and hierarchy theory is extended by finding a strong relationship between the two power bases in a decision-making process. This extended the study by Singh (2009), who stated that expert power has a substantial influence on decision-making processes. Expert power is found a basis for decisions, and requisite to climb up the hierarchy. However, hierarchy is found to defeat expert power in some specific cases.","2021-06-30","2022-10-06 19:40:46","2022-10-06 19:40:49","2022-10-06 19:40:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","theses.ubn.ru.nl","","Accepted: 2021-08-13T11:58:15Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study is pertinent and relevant because of the increasingly rapid internationalization that is happening in the Finnish higher education system. Understanding aspects of intercultural teacher-student communication will be important for the future.    A qualitative research process was chosen for this study and the data was collected by conducting in-depth interviews with 10 international students. They were asked about their experiences, perceptions and feelings while communicating with Finnish professors. Analysis and interpretation of the data  indicated that the cultural background of students did impact their expectancies and interpretation regarding teacher power. They experienced expectancy violations with respect to the unanticipated informality of Finnish professors characterized by informal methods of address, friendliness and an apparent  lack of authority. The results were analyzed primarily by using Hofstede’s and Schwartz’s cultural dimensions, face negotiation theory and politeness theory by Brown & Levinson and Scollon & Scollon and with Expectancy Violations Theory by Burgoon.    The overall conclusion is that the cultural differences between Finnish professors and international students do have an impact on power in teacher-student communication. Expectancy violations of this power led to negative feelings of frustration, disappointment and lack of motivation in the  respondents. On the other hand, some of the respondents indicated that they also felt more comfortable with the Finnish system and their expectations had changed.","2011","2022-10-06 19:41:16","2022-10-06 19:41:31","2022-10-06 19:41:16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","This publication is copyrighted.

In response to this critique, the purpose of this study is threefold. First, limitations of the logical positivist approach to culture are discussed. Second, a dialectical conceptualization of culture is presented and finally, a dialectically grounded etic methodology is developed. As an example, one aspect of mainstream U.S. American culture is analyzed by coding value appeals in television commercials. The results yield a picture of mainstream U.S. American culture that is characterized by efficiency, familial affiliation, independence, and a concern for health. Although mainly individualistic values are seen to portray U.S. mainstream American culture, the dialectical approach enables to account for and integrate a surprising number of collectivistic values. The dialectically grounded methodology developed is shown to have the potential to overcome some of the limitations that plague current research on culture. Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed methodology, how it is best applied, and directions for future research are discussed.","","2022-10-06 19:41:47","2022-10-06 19:41:47","2022-10-06 19:41:47","","81","","","","","Understanding culture as communication","","","","","California State University, Long Beach","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493496016","","","","","Social sciences; Language; Communication and the arts; literature and linguistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This dissertation examined the extent to which the print and broadcast news media have served two masters: the Chinese Communist Party, which attempted to dictate news content to bolster regime legitimacy, and the consumer, who preferred uncensored news reports, which occasionally portray the one-party state in a negative light. The use of qualitative methods explored pressures that have challenged state capacity to control the media, including decentralization of media management, market competition, journalistic professionalization and global information flows. Case studies on the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic in 2003 and Taiwan presidential election in 2004 as well as quantitative analysis of 5,883 news reports revealed the extent to which news content was controlled by the Communist Party. In spite of growing pressures affecting news media operations, the Communist Party has proven remarkably successful at re-making its capacity to control the media, preventing the rise of ideological threats to regime survival transmitted through news reports, and utilizing the mass media to dominate political discourse in China.","","2022-10-06 19:42:01","2022-10-06 19:42:01","2022-10-06 19:42:01","","260","","","","","Caught between state and society","","","","","Columbia University","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780542580802","","","","","Social sciences; China; News media; Communication and the arts; Commercial media; Media freedom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study the nature of correctional education management is explored in relation to the self-concept of offenders as learners, as well as their view and experience on their future position as released parolees striving for reintegration into the society. Methodologically, the study is located in the qualitative paradigm where a questionnaire was designed to gather the respondents’ demographic profiles, and to extract from them the factors that influence crime propensity and amenability to correction through correctional education. The questionnaire was targeted at all functionally literate participants who indicated their interest at the sampling stage. The research site was a Correctional Centre in the Gauteng Province. Respondents comprised sixteen offenders and five officials. The key findings of this research are that policy intervention is crucial to improve the management of offenders’ education, so to remove barriers that hinder the exercise of effective education. How offenders’ education is managed impacts on their receptiveness of education. This implies their fate as future ex-offenders and their prospects of employment after release as citizens are tarnished with the stigma of a criminal record. Their self-esteem seems to improve with the acquisition of well managed education, while on the other hand, propensity to recidivate is high where the management of their education has failed and hopelessness and lack of motivation in planning for a better future pervade. Thus, proper management of offenders’ education can go a long way to ensure their successful reintegration in the society. The research report concludes with recommendations that could have implications for future research in the context of correctional education management, as well as implementation and monitoring of such management via policy in order to achieve optimum rehabilitation of offenders.","2012-11","2022-10-06 19:43:06","2022-10-06 19:43:09","2022-10-06 19:43:06","","","","","","","Exploring the management of offenders' education for optimum rehabilitation","","","","","","","en","University of South Africa","","","","uir.unisa.ac.za","","Accepted: 2013-03-05T09:57:44Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This practicum report details the process of working with couples from a feminist informed structural therapy perspective. This interventive approach was based on theoretical assumptions of structural therapy that were supplemented by feminist social work practice principles. The practicum took place in Des Moines, Iowa, at the Family Counseling Center. Fourteen low income couples received conjoint therapy services.

This paper develops a conceptual framework, based on Rousseau's [38] psychological contract theory, to address the retention concern. Additional literatures that enhance the conceptual framework suggest that the antecedents of fit, besides preferred employment arrangement, include IT employee stages and anchors, IT competencies, and organizational factors, including IT human resource practices. IT human resource strategy, in turn, impacts the organizational factors. The conceptual framework incorporates additional antecedents of intention to stay, including other employment opportunities, virtual team factors, and individual factors.

This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence and severity of dental caries and their association with demographic and socio-economic variables in Brazilian preschoolers. Methods. The study population comprised 1487 0- to 5-year-old children attending government nurseries in Canoas, southern Brazil. Questionnaires regarding information related to the independent variables (age, gender, maternal level of education, and family income) were completed by the parents. Clinical examinations were carried out by five trained examiners and results were expressed using the deft index (World Health Organization criteria), including white spots. The outcomes considered in this study were caries occurrence (deft > 0) and caries severity (deft). Results. Forty per cent of the children (589/1487) presented dental caries [mean deft (SD): 1.53 (2.75)]. Deft increased with age (P < 0.001) and was significantly higher in children from mothers with low educational level (P = 0.001) and low family income (P = 0.001). The greatest increase in caries prevalence and severity occurred between age groups of 1 and 2 years. Logistic regression demonstrated higher odds of dental caries with mother's completing < 4 years education, after adjusting for confounding. Conclusion.

Simon acknowledged Friedrich A. Hayek as a founder of the notion of bounded rationality; yet Simon considered Hayek’s perspective incomplete, and, more in general, their views on market mechanisms, planning, and organization exhibit considerable differences. The comparison between these authors sheds light on Simon’s interpretation of planning, which emerges within his theory of organization (and not in traditional debates on socialism). Contrary to Hayek, he maintained that planning, in specific circumstances, is more advantageous than the market; and in both administration and organization, it involves a decentralized structure based on near independent sub-units. Decentralization of decisions also appears in social planning, which evolves through continuous interactions among planners (i.e., agents and institutions), and it is a process connoted by the absence of “fixed goals”. Finally, Simon defined modern economies more in terms of “organizational economies” than in those of “market economies” and this highlights a further difference with respect to the Austrian economist. This leads to analysis of the nature of organizations as hierarchical and “near-decomposable” structures, which refers to Simon’s theory of complexity and gives an epistemological explanation to the relation between centralization and decentralization.","2010-06-01","2022-10-06 19:45:04","2022-10-06 19:45:04","2022-10-06 19:45:04","145-170","","2","21","","Const Polit Econ","Is H.A.

This paper proposes a hierarchical redistribution hypothesis. The idea is that US firms have systematically redistributed income to the top of the corporate hierarchy. I test this hypothesis using a large scale hierarchy model of the US private sector. My method is to vary the rate that income scales with hierarchical rank within modeled firms. I find that this model is able to reproduce four intercorrelated US trends: (1) the growth of the top 1% income share; (2) the growth of the CEO pay ratio; (3) the growth of the dividends share of national income; and (4) the ""fattening"" of the entire income distribution tail. This result supports the hierarchical redistribution hypothesis. It is also consistent with the available empirical evidence on within-firm income redistribution.","2018","2022-10-06 19:46:18","2022-10-06 19:46:18","2022-10-06 19:46:18","","","","","","","The growth of US top income inequality","","","","","Working Papers on Capital as Power","","eng","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Working Paper","","","www.econstor.eu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018/05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study utilized Kenneth Burke's theory of the guilt-purification-redemption cycle, and considered Elphaba's journey between the three steps of Burke's cycle. In order to understand this journey better, the researcher considered various facets of the show, including the script, lyrics, costuming, including attire and make-up, and interactions with other characters in the production. Elphaba's causes of guilt, including her mother's death, her relationship with Glinda, her cause in working with Animals, and failed magic were discussed. Following this, was a discussion of her various attempts at purification, including both mortification and scapegoating, and finally her ultimate redemption both in her own eyes and those who meant the most to her. By the finale of the Wicked production, audiences see Elphaba gain redemption. Though she does not necessarily gain forgiveness or redemption from those around her in Oz, she does finally learn to accept herself, and unhindered by peer pressure, Elphaba is able to live the life for which she has always hoped.","","2022-10-06 19:48:05","2022-10-06 19:48:05","2022-10-06 19:48:04","","113","","","","","""It's just that for the first time, I feel… wicked""","","","","","Liberty University","United States -- Virginia","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781303037566","","","","","Communication and the arts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, this research (a) documents the types of uncertainty clergy newcomers experience during organizational entry; (b) identifies the sources newcomers rely on for social support; (c) explores the relative importance of structural, demographic, and personality variables on organizational encounter; and (d) discusses the implications this has for ministerial preparation and practice. Subjects included a networking sample of 206 clergy from 38 different Christian denominations who completed a survey concerning denomination and local church government type, congregational age, growth pattern, theological orientation, communication behavior, as well as demographic data. Dependent measures included uncertainty type, difficulty of organizational entry, role clarity, and job satisfaction. The link between uncertainty and information seeking was explored first. Paired-difference t-tests revealed that clergy newcomers experience referent (information) uncertainty most frequently, as do other types of newcomers. However, clergy report greater amounts of relational uncertainty, underscoring the interpersonal nature of pastoral ministry. Canonical correlation analysis revealed that denominations and churches with representative governmental structures, as well as older congregations, tend to produce higher levels of referent and relational uncertainty. Conversely, senior pastors with higher scores on communication competence, perceived social support, and positive communicator style experienced lower levels of all types of uncertainty. Lastly, t-tests revealed that all clergy rely most on prayer and meditation for social support. Married clergy evidence a utilization hierarchy with spouse first, then church members and professional sources, other clergy next, and friends and family members last. Unmarried clergy however, rely on all of these sources equally (except spouse) but utilize friends and counselors more than married clergy do. A series of regression analyses were computed in order to evaluate the organizational entry outcomes in terms of structural, personality, and demographic variables. Results suggest that communication competence, perceived emotional support, age, tenure, growth pattern, type of assignment, and theological orientation are the most powerful predictors of organizational entry outcomes.","","2022-10-06 19:48:14","2022-10-06 19:48:14","2022-10-06 19:48:14","","226","","","","","Getting to know you","","","","","The Ohio State University","United States -- Ohio","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798208888285","","","","","Communication and the arts; Philosophy; religion and theology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research followed the life course of pupils at the school from the time they were admitted to the time they left and then throughout their working lives to measure the extent of intragenerational and intergenerational social mobility. Subsequently, the mobility was then correlated to the extent of their educational achievements to determine whether their education enabled them to acquire a higher status role or move into a higher social class. The study found that the school provided quality education in comparison to other schools in the locality, and evidence suggests that overall those boys who excelled academically were more likely to obtain a beneficial apprenticeship. However they did not necessarily need academic skills to succeed and secure a degree of social mobility as the social capital they also acquired within the school was found to be as beneficial – if not more so – than their educational achievements. For the girls there was little sign that their education enhanced their status.","2019-12-11","2022-10-06 19:48:25","2022-10-06 19:48:25","2022-10-06 19:48:25","","409","","","","","","","","","","University of Birmingham","","English","","d_ph","","","etheses.bham.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A comparative case study design was employed utilizing interviews (N = 45) of component supplier top management and project management personnel and company documents (N = 2,000) as the primary data sources. At each field site, a longitudinal case history for a military and a commercial aerospace development project was retrospectively constructed from both data sources. The dissertation compared the three component suppliers in terms of the contextual antecedents, governance structures, interaction processes and performance outcomes for six product development projects with major U.S. and European aerospace manufacturer customers. Resource dependence, transaction cost and institutional theory perspectives were employed for organizing construct measurement, case sampling and data collection efforts, and for formulating research propositions with which to compare predicted to observed patterns of case study findings. Study findings most strongly supported institutional theory predictions of differences in military and commercial project governance safeguards and performance outcomes. Findings marginally supported transaction cost predictions of associations between task uncertainty, bureaucratic governance, and customer commitments. Findings did not support resource dependence predictions that customer dependence reduced a supplier's control over project resources. However, customer dependence was associated with supplier technical competencies that were narrowly specialized to customer requirements. Findings also supported resource-based strategy theory predictions that technical competency in product design was associated with greater use of proprietary information safeguards. Also, exceptional technical competency in either product design or flexible manufacturing was associated with more positive evaluations of customer relations than evaluations by suppliers ""stuck in the middle"". An unexpected finding was that technical agenda supplier-customer interactions and resource commitments preceded and were loosely coupled to commercial agenda interactions and explicit contract commitments.","","2022-10-06 19:48:34","2022-10-06 19:48:34","2022-10-06 19:48:34","","365","","","","","Supplier-customer collaboration in commercial and military aerospace projects","","","","","Yale University","United States -- Connecticut","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798207430935","","","","","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article looks at a battery of organizational options aimed at transforming health care systems and argues that more attention must be paid to reforming the delivery mechanisms that are so crucial for health care systems' overall performance. To support improvement, policies can rely on organizational assets in two ways. First, reforms can promote the creation of new organizational forms; second, they can employ organizational levers (e.g., capacity development, team-based organizations, evidence-informed practices) to achieve specific policy goals. In both cases organizational assets are mobilized with a view to creating complete health care organizations — that is to say, organizations that have the capacity to function as high-performing systems. The challenges confronting the development of more complete health care organizations are significant. Real health care system reforms may likewise require implementing ecologies of complex innovation at the clinical, organizational, and policy levels. Policies play a determining role in shaping these new spaces for action so that day-to-day practices may change.","2012-08-01","2022-10-06 19:49:12","2022-10-06 19:49:12","2022-10-06 19:49:12","633-645","","4","37","","Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law","Real Reform Begins Within","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A cognition and culture account of social group stereotypes","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1618021476/abstract/9DCAE7D66B54480BPQ/1","This thesis explores the potential of the 'Cognition and Culture' approach to serve as a conceptual framework to facilitate an integrated study of the contents of social group stereotypes and the cognitive processes and structures underpinning stereotyping. More specifically, it explores the extent to which evolved cognitive predispositions may shape the contents of stereotypes, and facilitate the naturalization of status differences between groups. Experiments 1-3 utilized the Minimal Group Paradigm to investigate whether cognitive predispositions shape the contents of social group stereotypes. Experiment 1 provided evidence for a default stereotyping mode based on two dimensions found to capture social group stereotypes universally: competence and morality/warmth. Participants rated members of their own group as competent and moral/warm. Experiment 2 provided evidence for a default status stereotyping mode. Participants rated members of high status groups as competent and members of low status groups as incompetent. Experiment 3 replicated the findings of experiment 2 using an implicit measure of stereotyping. These are the first experiments to provide evidence for stereotyping in minimal groups. The final three experiments explored whether humans hold essentialist beliefs about social status as this mode of category representation may facilitate the purported ability of stereotypes to naturalise status differences between groups. In experiment 4 it was found that status differences trigger essentialist beliefs about social groups. Experiment 5 explored essentialist beliefs about group-based social status using two thought experiment paradigms. No evidence was found for essentialist beliefs about group-based social status. However, there was an indication from participants' qualitative responses that these paradigms were not optimal. A final follow-up experiment found evidence for essentialist beliefs about group-based social status using the soul exchange paradigm. Implications for the social psychology of stereotyping, the 'Cognition and Culture' approach and social policy are discussed.","","2022-10-06 19:49:42","2022-10-06 19:49:42","2022-10-06 19:49:42","","344","","","","","Made to stick?","","","","","London School of Economics and Political Science (United Kingdom)","England","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781321337433","","","","","Psychology; Stereotypes; (UMI)AAIU615734; Social groups","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bridging migration theory and comparative political economy, it is argued that variation in labour market institutions shapes variation in levels of labour immigration and the type of employment undertaken by migrant workers across advanced democracies. This theory is supported by empirical evidence from Western Europe and in particular Italy and Ireland. Furthermore, it is explored whether, given the relationship between labour market institutions and labour immigration, policymakers are stimulated by concerns regarding immigration - the ‘Migrant Worker Factor’ - to reform labour market institutions. More specifically, it is investigated whether the Migrant Worker Factor stimulated employment standards compliance (ESC) system reforms and the development of active labour market policy (ALMP) in Ireland, Italy and shadow cases Britain and France during the period 1997 - mid 2008. It is also explored whether the Migrant Worker Factor was part of the rationale behind vocational education and training (VET) system reforms of the same period in Ireland and Britain. These case studies found empirical evidence that concerns regarding labour immigration can be a causal factor in the reform of labour market institutions. Certain ESC system reforms were partly motivated by the aim of safeguarding domestic worker jobs and employment standards, as well as controlling migrant inflows. Moreover, in some cases, ALMP development and VET system reforms in part aimed to provide domestic alternatives to migrant workers. The impact of the Migrant Worker Factor depends on the level of concern regarding labour immigration in a given state. Furthermore, the influence of this variable on labour market institutional reform is mediated by learning and coordination mechanisms and assumptions regarding the substitutability of migrant workers.

"746WCX4Q","thesis","2014","Diaz, Cecilia","A study of complexity, innovation and variety; the photographic camera example","","","","","https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/333011/","This thesis is an exploratory research concerned with the investigation and identification of complex systems and their innovation life patterns. There is evidence in the literature to suggest the existence of complex systems, which differentiate themselves not only by organisational structure, but also by the way, they innovate.  Complex systems seem to display a nested hierarchical formation of technological elements and the clustering of those technological elements in a synergistic manner in order to offer an enhanced service. Another distinct element of complex systems is the dependency that some particular elements in the hierarchy seem to display. This dependency of the elements in the nested hierarchy means that changes (innovation) made in one of the elements of the hierarchy might result in changes in other elements or the whole hierarchy. These characteristics not only differentiate complex from simple systems but are also the main reason why complex systems innovate in a different manner from simple systems (classical view of innovation). There is an important gap in the study of innovation in complex systems in the literature. Firstly, if in fact complex systems innovate differently from simple systems there is no evidence of a model that could clearly identify and separate complex from simple systems. Secondly, previous research on complex systems theory and innovation has studied complexity as a whole; however, the dependency between the elements is the crucial factor that hinders complex systems from innovating according to the classical view of innovation. There is no indication in the literature of a model that could clearly identify those distinct elements within the complex systems hierarchy that display the dependency. If there was a model that could identify the risk elements in the systems that carry the dependency, marketing/design managers could develop more efficient innovation strategies without putting at risk the performance of some elements of the systems or the whole product.  	This research proposes a model that could help to identify the particular elements that display that dependency and the possible effect that it could have in the whole hierarchy. This model is also used as a tool to identify and separate complex systems from simple systems. This research uses cameras in an example study to test the models suggested by this research. Previous research on complexity has been done in an industrial market; however, there is no empirical evidence in the literature of a model that could help the investigation of the evolution of complex systems in a commercial market. Products in a commercial market are subject to heterogeneity of demand, speed of innovation, and sophistication of needs. A model that could map the innovation pattern of commercial complex systems could help marketing and design companies with innovation strategies and decisions. 	In this research, this model was applied to the camera example and, in fact, cameras gave high indications and displayed clear evidence that could lead to the classification of cameras as complex systems. Cameras display evidence both of dependency between the elements and of a nested hierarchical formation, which are the elements that separate complex from simple systems. 	Subsequent to the finding of the evidences that support cameras as complex systems, this research investigates the innovation pattern of cameras from 1955 to 2011, and compares this innovation pattern to the classical view of both innovation and complex systems. As indicated in the literature, even though cameras have some elements common to the classical view of innovation at the beginning of the innovation life cycle, they display a rather different pattern closer to that offered by complex systems innovation. 	By applying this model, this research not only seems to help the classification and distinguishing complex from simple systems but also studies the complex system as a whole, and the identification of the elements that display dependency and could put any innovation activity at risk. This model also offers the possibility of studying innovation and clearly identifying to what extent and in which manner complex systems innovate differently from simple systems.","2014","2022-10-06 19:52:24","2022-10-06 19:52:24","2022-10-06 19:52:24","","","","","","","","","","","","Manchester Metropolitan University","","en","cc_by_nc_nd_4","doctoral","","","e-space.mmu.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

S. Department of Defense (DoD). To achieve flexibility, most practice and research emphasizes process improvement, robust collaboration and ""flattened"" or ""networked"" organizations. Lateral alignment has also been proposed as a means to enable flexibility. Missing from these approaches is an appreciation and understanding of the role of architecture and hierarchy as well how to apply these ideas at the enterprise level of organization. The DoD has embraced information technology as one means to achieve flexibility via these methods. Within DoD the Air Force is a uniquely flexible combat arm, but it has proven particularly difficult to integrate air power at the level of inter-service (Joint) military operations in order to leverage this flexibility. Kometer (ESD Ph.D., 2005) used a complex, large-scale, interconnected, open, socio-technical (CLIOS) systems analysis to examine command and control of the Combat Air Operations System (CAOS), proposing new command and control concepts to gain flexibility. This thesis extends Kometer's research by using a qualitative architectural analysis to explore the twin ideas of hierarchy and laterality in enabling flexibility. We define lateral interactions as those within the same layer of an enterprise hierarchy. Lateral interactions enable formalized collaboration among peer entities, which can enable more operational alternatives and make these alternatives executable on more responsive timelines than possible with classic hierarchical structures.","2009","2022-10-06 19:52:31","2022-10-06 19:52:31","2022-10-06 19:52:31","","","","","","","Operational flexibility on complex enterprises","","","","","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","","eng","M.I.T. theses are protected by  copyright.

"GBBP4HYF","thesis","","DiGiovanni, Laura","Accuracy of eyewitness identification of Black Americans as a function of Social Dominance Orientation and cross race contact","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/230937910/abstract/85A66D4BDF124057PQ/1","This study was designed to examine the effect of Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) on eyewitness identification, specifically cross race identifications. Research shows that cross race identifications have a higher likelihood of being incorrect than same race identifications (Anthony, Copper, & Mullen, 1992; Bothwell, Brigham, & Malpass, 1989; Teitelbaum & Geiselman, 1997). Past research (Chance, Goldstein, & McBride, 1975; Goldstein & McBride, 1975; Malpass, Lavigueur, and Weldon, 1973) indicates that the amount of contact with members of other races may influence the ability to accurately identify other race individuals in lineups. SDO has received limited attention in the criminal justice literature but may moderate the ability to make cross race identifications. SDO is an individual difference variable that pertains to one's preference for group based social hierarchies. Individuals high on SDO hold different beliefs regarding the criminal justice system (Perkins & Bourgeois, 2006). A goal of the present study was to extend the literature on SDO and the criminal justice system to include eyewitness identifications. Participants first completed measures of SDO and amount of cross race contact. They then viewed two video clips of college age males; one video featured a Caucasian individual and the other a Black individual. Upon returning two days later, participants made lineup identifications, Remember, Know, Guess judgments, and reported on their willingness to testify in court on their identifications. It was hypothesized that individuals high on SDO will report less contact with other race individuals, which in turn will lead to lower accuracy rates for cross race identifications. Results showed that participants were more accurate when making the cross-race identification compared to the same-race identification. Furthermore, SDO did not predict cross-race and same-race identification accuracy. The lack of a cross race effect precluded testing the hypothesized relationship between SDO, cross-race contact, and identification accuracy. The current study falls into the class of studies that did not find the cross race effect. One possible reason why this study may have failed to find the cross-race effect is the social context of the stimuli.","","2022-10-06 19:52:42","2022-10-06 19:52:42","2022-10-06 19:52:42","","91","","","","","","","","","","Hofstra University","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781109705157","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology; Lineups; Social dominance orientation; Social dominance; Cross race contact; Cross race identification; Cross race lineups; Eyewitness identification; Eyewitnesses; guess; know; Remember","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I analyze fictional twins in the work of major American authors such as Toni Morrison, William Melvin Kelley, Eudora Welty, and Thornton Wilder, as well as popular children's authors; photographs of twins by Diane Arbus and Mary Ellen Mark; and real-life twins' events such as the Twins Festival in Twinsburg, OH, and life writing by twins that articulates twins' own self-constitution. Treating twinship as a cultural phenomenon, the chapters investigate these literary, visual, and non-fiction representations of twinship in relation to social-scientific and historical discourses to chart a historical narrative of twins in the U.S. This historical narrative of twinship—embedded within discourses of the freak show, racial eugenics, and experimentation—essentializes the innate otherness of twins and prescripts and delimits our understanding of twinship. My dissertation examines how twinship articulates U.S. anxieties about racial kinship, community membership, and cultural affiliation at both the national and social levels during specific historical moments when logics of racial and cultural identity are paramount, such as mass immigration and reactionary nativism during the Progressive era and the transition from Civil Rights to Black Power. Because twinship models a relationship of similarity and difference between individual twins while functioning as a group affiliation for them, I argue that the relationship between fictional twins becomes a productive metaphor through which to understand tensions between racial and cultural similarity and difference. The correlation of twinship with race or ethnicity signals the difference between understanding twinship as a fact determined by genetics and twinship as a cultural and social construction. This representational structure of twins and race underwrites the trope of twins in the U.S., which is over-determined by anxieties of racial, national, and communal affiliation.","","2022-10-06 19:52:49","2022-10-06 19:52:49","2022-10-06 19:52:49","","216","","","","","Anxieties of affiliation","","","","","Indiana University","United States -- Indiana","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781267078193","","","","","Social sciences; Language; Race; literature and linguistics; Community; Literature; Spectacle; Twinship; U.S.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four pre-modern Christian positions on the hiddenness of God: Augustine; Pseudo-Dionysius; Aquinas; Luther","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304231205/abstract/93DC22424EF84ABEPQ/1","The purpose of this dissertation is to chart the ways in which four seminal, pre-modern figures in the church's history-- Aurelius Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, Thomas Aquinas, and Martin Luther--understood the mystery and incomprehensibility of God. Two have consistently analogical programs which assume their termination to be in a beatific vision of the utter intelligibility of God: Augustine and Thomas. Augustine has what appears to be a fourfold distinction: God eludes us due to our sinfulness as we are confronted by God's freedom in salvific self-revelation, due to our created finitude as we encounter the infinite and triune creator, due to our inability to discern how God providentially orders history, and due to our impotence to penetrate the divine predestinating decision. Thomas' thought seems more naturally divided in a twofold manner: God is hidden due to the limits of reason in the context of sin and due to the limits of faith in the context of grace. The remaining two introduce hyperlogical elements that break the analogical project. Pseudo-Dionysius' analogical program broadly parallels Thomas: God is hidden due to creaturely privation and due to natural but salvific limitations. At the height of this, however, a hyperlogical or mystical theology overturns it and directs attention to the divine beyond hiddenness and revealedness, beyond affirmation and negation. Luther's approach broadly mirrors Augustine's: hiddenness at the limits of fallen reason; hiddenness as contrary to reasonable and experiential expectation; hiddenness at the limits of faith; hiddenness as contrary even to faith's expectations. Hyperlogy occurs at the second level, but in such a way that its final goal actually becomes that of analogy: beatific vision. All assume what we may call an organic divine hiddenness and a hierarchical one. With this investigated, these are then brought into dialogue with process, Heideggerian, liberation, and postmodern thought for further clarification. In this context, brief studies of the approaches of E. Jungel, J. Macquarrie, M. Bookchin, V. Araya, R. R. Ruether, G. Kaufman, H. Frei, G. Lindbeck, R. Thiemann, and T. Tracy are also presented.","","2022-10-06 22:00:59","2022-10-06 22:00:59","2022-10-06 22:00:59","","284","","","","","A transcending presence.

Fourteen hypotheses and one research question tested social capital propositions and postulates in a public relations-specific context, and a measure of social capital was created and tested alongside measures of human capital and organizational financial capital. A holistic model of social capital was tested using structural equation modeling such that human capital was hypothesized to predict social capital, human and social capital were hypothesized to predict public relations outcomes, and public relations outcomes were hypothesized to predict financial capital. It was concluded that the Social Capital Model of Public Relations alongside confirmed hypotheses provide evidence for social capital as a valid theory and concept for the study of public relations.

After defining empire and hierarchy in anarchy, I present a typology of international orders tuned to thinking about empire and its alternatives. The central section of the article explores three classes of formal inequalities common during the Westphalian era?special rights of Great Powers, restricted rights for outlaws, and a wide range of particular practices of ?semi-sovereignty?. I then sketch ten historically grounded models of hierarchical international relations. Two brief applications to contemporary American power seek to illustrate the value of this conceptual apparatus.

The MAS has found multiple applications, including modeling complex systems, smart grids, and computer networks. Despite their wide applicability, there are still a number of challenges faced by MAS, including coordination between agents, security, and task allocation.

The study is seeking to understand the roots of the human condition and how this condition manifests in the human group-field. Grounded in decades of group-oriented human service work, and extensive fieldwork training in the practice of group change agency, the PDE examines the group-field in light of two principle disciplines: living systems theory and Buddhism. These are the two “voices” in the PDE dialogue—how life emerges, grows and evolves, and how life awakens to its true nature. Based in the principles of general systems theory, the study focuses on Fritjof Capra's “unified theory of living systems” that seeks to answer the question, “what is life?” This includes the work of Ilya Prigogine, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, and Ken Wilber among others. From the orientation of Tibetan Buddhism, the PDE uses both a traditional and applied, or “socially engaged” Buddhist perspective to address the central Buddhist concern, “how do we liberate ourselves and others from suffering?” The common ground, between these two perspectives, is discussed as the phenomenon of karmic formation, or how external and internal phenomena arise. This traditional Buddhist understanding becomes, in the PDE, the framework for how the human group-field is examined. Central to all is the overarching theme of peacemaking, or helpful rather than harmful coexistence with the earth and its inhabitants. By weaving together the two principle “voices,” along with sociological, psychological, philosophical, anthropological, and geopolitical perspectives, this is a highly interdisciplinary study. It explores how humans make meaning about their world, hence how they act on that meaning and create helpful and harmful conditions. Results or findings of this study are understood as a deeper awareness of the human condition, and our collective ability to actually change that condition.","","2022-10-06 22:05:27","2022-10-06 22:05:27","2022-10-06 22:05:27","","615","","","","","Living systems, karmic formation, and peacemaking","","","","","Union Institute and University","United States -- Ohio","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780496093526","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology; Philosophy; religion and theology; Buddhism; Group dynamics; Karma; Peacemaking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"FXP7LF2D","thesis","","Ducey, Adam J.","The Cross-National Generalizability of Biographical Data: An Examination within a Multinational Organization","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1855573116/abstract/F843F6BD4CA24F1EPQ/1","In an increasingly interconnected economy, organizations are frequently operating beyond national borders. International partnerships, joint ventures, mergers, and acquisitions have expanded the labor market from a domestic to an international perspective. In this environment, multinational organizations demand cost-effective personnel selection tools to help them identify top talent from different countries, geographical regions, and cultures. The purpose of the current research was to evaluate the global utility of biographical data inventories, a standardized self-report selection method that asks job applicants questions about prior behaviors and experiences. Results from two studies involving participants from 7 country clusters, across four continents, and two different occupational groups, managers and manufacturing technicians, provided evidence to support the hypothesis that the validity of biographical data inventories, empirically keyed in the United States, generalizes to all country clusters examined. These results are important because they suggest that multinational organizations interested in deploying a single standardized selection system across geographical boundaries may want to consider including biographical data inventories, in addition to other commonly used instruments such as cognitive ability and personality assessments, to enhance the overall validity of their selection systems. This approach has the potential to reduce organizations’ costs related to developing, implementing, and maintaining selection processes while enabling them to manage their human capital efficiently by ensuring all new hires have the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to succeed on the job and contribute to their strategic objectives.","","2022-10-06 22:06:32","2022-10-06 22:06:32","2022-10-06 22:06:32","","139","","","","","The Cross-National Generalizability of Biographical Data","","","","","University of South Florida","United States -- Florida","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781369373776","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology; Biodata; Biographical data; Cross-national; Personnel selection; Test validation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the conventional firm with its rigid bureaucracies is still in use, many businesses have grown increasingly flexible, flat, and polycentric: “empowerment” and “innovation” are the coin of the realm. As the way we work changed, professional communication scholarship pivoted to consider communication practices in these structures. While professional communication scholars have long discussed these kinds of organizations, they have not discussed an increasingly popular alternative: cooperatives. Owned and operated by the people who use them, these organizations can significantly affect the communities in which they operate. To contribute to the rhetorical knowledge of cooperatives, I conducted a qualitative study at the Riverwest Public House Cooperative (“Public House”). This project extends research of flat organizations by investigating a cooperative business. I draw my research questions from the concerns scholars identified in other kinds of organizations: namely, the role of genres in configuring power and facilitating organizational change (Clark 2006; Devitt 1991; Spinuzzi 2007; Star 1991; Winsor 2003; Zachry 2000). 1. How does a cooperative employ genres differently? 2. What do these texts tell us about how power is distributed in a cooperative? 3. How do the genres it employs affect organizational change? These questions helped me better understand the connections between negotiations of power and texts at work in this particular business, leading me to several findings: 1. Genres. Collaboratively produced texts are the backbone of consensus-based decision-making. Unlike conventional organizations, in a cooperative, many (though not all) stakeholders are given access to governance. For instance, documents like an incident report or safer space policy have greater social significance when they are not only produced by agreement but also enforced through agreement. 2. Organizational Change. The Public House underwent a managerial overhaul during my study. Like conventional businesses, change occurred through a confluence of material circumstances and individual and organizational goals; however, due to the absence of formal structure, in this instance, a broader range of individuals was able to institute structural change. 3. Distribution of Power. In place of hierarchy, rhetorics of empowerment and democracy were deployed horizontally to task employees with managerial duties without financial rewards. For this project, I provide an interdisciplinary take on hierarchy and organizational structure by examining one cooperative, still in its infancy, through the lens of genre and power in the workplace.","","2022-10-06 22:06:39","2022-10-06 22:06:39","2022-10-06 22:06:39","","161","","","","","Collective management in a cooperative","","","","","The University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee","United States -- Wisconsin","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781339828473","","","","","Language; Hierarchy; Cooperatives; Communication and the arts; literature and linguistics; Empowerment; Actor-network theory; Horizontal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three research questions focused on the team's consciousness of a need to change under adversity, its response through adaptive action, and its potential for innovation through creative destruction. The study used flexible design and mixed methods by applying grounded theory coding techniques to understand a retrospective case study. The subject was the CUSD2009 Team of approximately 200 students and faculty members, which designed and built a solar house over a 2-year period for an international competition with 19 other teams sponsored by the United States Department of Energy. The project team's development was investigated through archival documents, 30 interviews, field notes, and direct observations. Theoretical, empirical, and historically relevant literature was reviewed pertaining to group development, adaptive cycles, complex adaptive systems, and creative destruction. Data analysis used a multilevel approach consisting of coding the data through the lenses of two models and a theory. Relationships between models of group development, the complex adaptive cycle, and complex adaptive systems theory were established theoretically and empirically. Results of the three research questions indicated that the team exhibited agency through the following: (a) collective consciousness of a need for change to maintain the team's function toward the project goals, (b) collective action to make necessary changes, and (c) emergence of innovation through creative destruction entailing renegotiation of group norms in response to an adversity. Through this methodology, emergent categories were revealed related to resilience and creative destruction. The multilevel analysis culminated in an integrated systems perspective with conclusions about resilience in project teams, specifically the role of environmental feedback. Implications for future research using complex adaptive systems as a theoretical foundation for studying group development and resilience include organizational culture, inflection points, nested adaptive cycles, emergence of leadership, and emergence of innovation. This research contributes a deeper understanding of project team resilience in organizational systems such as companies, non-profits, governmental, and non-governmental entities by revealing the importance of environmental feedback and organizational learning to build adaptive capacity.","","2022-10-06 22:06:46","2022-10-06 22:06:46","2022-10-06 22:06:45","","287","","","","","","","","","","Saybrook University","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781124628127","","","","","Resilience; Leadership; Social sciences; Innovation; Applied sciences; Complex adaptive systems; Group development; Project teams","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a significant strand of it approached the international order from above, privileging the perspective of dominant actors. I make the case for a from-below approach to hierarchical orders, recognising and accounting for understudied experiences in world politics, but also developing a more accurate understanding of hierarchy. Through a relational-sociological approach, I conceptualise hierarchy as a socially differentiated system predicated on recognition. The experience of misrecognition by way of normative and material constraints constitutes actors as subordinates. I propose a framework for subordinate actors? navigation of hierarchy in quest of social recognition. I identify three strategies that subordinates employ, depending on the misrecognising constraints they counter (normative/material) and the recognition they seek (internal/external). Subordinates may engage in norm appropriation, alternative leveraging, and salvation from victimhood. I demonstrate the applicability of the framework by examining Egypt?s quest for recognition in the aftermath of the 2013 military coup.","2021-09-01","2022-10-06 22:07:09","2022-10-06 22:07:09","2022-10-06 22:07:09","55-82","","1","50","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fieldwork involved three dimensions of observable lay activity: interaction with deities through ritual and devotion, interaction with mendicants, and ascetic practices. In all three dimensions, the dissertation documents and analyzes this activity, and elucidates both the orthodox interpretation of the behavior and the participants' own understanding of the behavior. The portrait of the contemporary Jain tradition which emerges from this research is very different from the standard academic portrait based on the orthodox prescriptive model. The orthodox ideology of the path to liberation (moksa-marg) gives a negative valuation of the material universe, and stresses ascetic practices designed to reduce the bondage of karma and thereby escape from mundane existence. But encompassed within the Jain tradition is another realm of value, an ideology expressed not explicitly through dogmatic statements but rather implicitly through symbols. In this second realm of value, the religious ideal is expressed in a galaxy of concepts which indicate a positive valuation of a person's place in the universe. Emphasis is upon accumulation of merit (punya) and the reduction of sin (pap), designed to make one more holy and sacred (mangal). The model of the Jain tradition that is developed in the dissertation involves not a single ideology of liberation, but rather a tension between two different expressions of ultimate sacred value which are in constant interaction in all facets of Jain religious practice and belief. This dissertation presents a new perspective upon the Jain tradition. It makes a significant contribution to the ongoing discussion about the underlying structure of Indian society and culture, and the nature of religion and the religious in India. The discussion of the interaction between Jain religious values and those of the surrounding Hindu traditions also contributes to broader issues in the history of religions, including the interaction of differing notions of sacrality, and differing definitions of the realms of the religious and the social.","","2022-10-06 22:07:39","2022-10-06 22:07:39","2022-10-06 22:07:39","","569","","","","","Liberation and well-being","","","","","Harvard University","United States -- Massachusetts","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798643106661","","","","","Social sciences; India; Philosophy; religion and theology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article is a report of a study that identifies organizational characteristics explaining employee solidarity in the long-term care sector. Background. Employee solidarity reportedly improves organizations’ effectiveness and efficiency. Although general research on solidarity in organizations is available, the impact of the organizational context on solidarity in long-term care settings is lacking. Design. Cross-sectional survey. Method. The study was carried out in Dutch long-term care. A total of 313 nurses, managers and other care professionals in 23 organizations were involved. Organizational characteristics studied were centralization, hierarchical culture, formal and informal exchange of information and leadership style. The study was carried out in 2009. Findings. All organizational characteristics significantly correlated with employee solidarity in the univariate analyses. In the multivariate analyses hierarchical culture, centralization, exchange of formal and informal information and transformational leadership appears to be important for solidarity among nurses, managers and other professionals in long-term care organizations, but not transactional and passive leadership styles. Conclusion. The study increased our knowledge of solidarity among nurses, managers and other professionals in the long-term care settings. Organizational characteristics that enhance solidarity are high levels of formal and informal information exchange, less hierarchical authority, decentralization and transformational leadership styles.","2013","2022-10-06 22:08:13","2022-10-06 22:08:13","2022-10-06 22:08:13","526-534","","3","69","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2012.06027.x","","","","","communication; leadership; management; solidarity; healthcare; nurse/nursing; organizational characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is an implied and broadly accepted connection between these aspects of organisational life, yet the connection has not been clearly developed within either the employment relations or employee rewards literature. Employment relations research commonly prioritises certain features: organisational context; parties’ ideologies; processes concerning the interaction of the parties; and outcomes of the relationship. This study attempts to be located in this tradition: it regards rewards as an outcome of the employment relationship. However, whilst many studies of this type have tended to emphasise the interaction of isolated features, this study attempts to theorise the nature of the interactions between the reward outcomes and the other features of the relationship in a holistic manner. The study begins from an ontologically realist view of the employment relationship and employee rewards; however, it also acknowledges that these social facts are interpreted by parties, and that these interpretations are significant. The study adopts many of the features of mainstream employment relations research, reflected in a pluralist theoretical perspective. A predominantly inductive, multi-method, case study research strategy is utilised, focussing upon two unionised, private sector, manufacturing organisations. Data is collected from the parties to the employment relationship using research instruments derived from two primary conceptual models: Walton & McKersie’s (1965) behavioural bargaining framework, and Gomez-Mejia and Balkin’s (1992) algorithmic-experiential model of rewards. Analysis of this data indicates substantial commonality between the cases and suggests a complex set of interactions between the features of the employment relationship and employee reward outcomes. Key findings indicate the importance of understanding parties’ reward preferences as they provide insight regarding: the formulation of parties’ ideologies; the effectiveness of processes; and the interpretation of reward outcomes.","","2022-10-06 22:08:20","2022-10-06 22:08:20","2022-10-06 22:08:20","","320","","","","","Rewarding Relationships","","","","","University of Northumbria at Newcastle (United Kingdom)","England","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798790673795","","","","","Employee reward programs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to use a systems perspective to understand how our current social structure, patriarchy, is related to attitudes about war and peace. It was proposed that patriarchy can be described as more than the existence of male dominance in a society, but by a complex belief system made up of particular values, attitudes, and ways of behaving that help to perpetuate inequality, violence, and war. One hundred fifty-five adults, ranging in age from 19 to 84, completed a questionnaire surveying attitudes about male dominance, competitive-hierarchy, instrumentalism, traditional masculinity, and evaluative statements about war and peace. Following an exploratory factor analysis, a structural equation model was proposed in which the four measures of patriarchal structure (dominance, competitive-hierarchy, instrumentalism, and masculinity), form a latent variable, ""Patriarchy"", which is negatively related to a latent variable, ""Peace"", made up of war and peace. Results showed that the data fit the proposed model, with slight variations that indicated that some other concept, in addition to patriarchy, explained some proportion of variance in the four patriarchal structure variables. Possible interpretations were discussed, including the possibility that ""Peace"" accounts for some of the unexplained variance in the four patriarchal variables. It appears that the concepts of ""Patriarchy"" and ""Peace"" represent a complex relationship in which patriarchal values and attitudes form a belief system that is antithetical to the attainment of true peace. The implications of these findings for systems change were forwarded. It was proposed that in order to promote a more peaceful world, we must begin to change some of these destructive patriarchal values. Ideas for systems change were discussed in terms of the peaceful changes that are already occurring in the world as a result of the grassroots of feminism, spirituality, and environmentalism.","","2022-10-06 22:08:27","2022-10-06 22:08:27","2022-10-06 22:08:27","","155","","","","","Patriarchal structures and the acceptance of war and peace","","","","","California School of Professional Psychology - Los Angeles","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798207121970","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, recent research by Leach and Cidam (2015) has revealed that shame can also lead to reparative behaviors when the shameful situation is perceived as repairable. This finding has important implications for understanding the mechanisms that lead to unexplained cultural differences. Specifically, shame is associated with withdrawal behaviors in individualistic cultures, but with reparative behaviors in collectivistic cultures. This dissertation tests a model that integrates both lines of research to explain why these differences emerge. The model assumes that shame is perceived as repairable when reparation includes engaging in culturally learned behavior patterns (i.e., repairing the culturally-congruent self); especially when that aspect of self is shamed. Four studies test this hypothesis by randomly assigning individuals to experience (Study 1) or recall (Study 2 through 4) a shameful situation that targeted the independent or interdependent self. Across the four studies, participants were provided the option to repair the aspect of self that was shamed, the aspect of self that was congruent with their self-construal (self-direction) or to engage in non-repair. Findings showed that individuals were more likely to engage in a non-reparative task over a reparative one, and that those high in self-direction were more likely to repair the self than those low in self-direction. Further, cultural differences in the behavioral consequences of shame reflected conditions of incongruence, rather than congruence. In Study 1, those high in self-direction were more likely than those low in self-direction to repair the independent self when the interdependent self and to repair the interdependent self when the independent self was shamed. In Study 4, when the independent self was shamed, those high in self-direction were most likely to select the non-reparative option compared to those low in self-direction. Conversely, those low in self-direction were most likely to repair the interdependent self.

An important element of this program in some countries has been the emphasis on institutional approaches, especially with respect to upgrading of the small, communal irrigation systems. However, a major source of difficulty in developing improved irrigation water management systems is the problem of differential access to water. Because of physical and topographic factors, unequal access is always incipient (and often widespread) in canal systems, as evidenced by the prevalance of the so-called ""tail-end"" syndrome. Social and institutional aspects are recognized as active factors in the determination of access conditions and, through traditional principles and practices, may serve as countervailing variables to the inequality inherent in the physical set-up of the system. These relationships are investigated for a communal irrigation system in Umingan, Pangasinan, Philippines. The study area is considered uniquely interesting in that cross comparison of head vs. tail farms and conventional vs. zangjera (irrigation society) type land parcels, together with time-series observations provide a rich source of information which is of potential significance for policy. In particular, the years for which data is analyzed covers the period of intensive rice cultivation and a period of radical transformation of the community (following the entry of a corporate rice farming scheme which introduced an intensive version of the government's credit and production program). The study deals with conventional (physical and engineering) aspects of water management problems. It supplements historical and ethnographic investigative techniques with multiple regression for the quantification and verification of differential access variables. The first technique uses historical documentation and participant observation, and the second technique allows for quantification of the role of physical and institutional factors in the determination of water stress days (observed at the farm level) and in the perception by farmers of water adequacy.","","2022-10-06 22:09:28","2022-10-06 22:09:28","2022-10-06 22:09:28","","421","","","","","Social and Institutional Factors in Differential Access to Canal Irrigation","","","","","The University of Wisconsin - Madison","United States -- Wisconsin","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798204460454","","","","","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The quality of life of the occupants, and how they chose to improve it, is identified through a range of documentary and archaeological sources. It is shown that the barracks complex was a place of domestic life within the confines of an institution. It is evident in the material culture that everyday activities of occupants included the preparation of food, presentation of the home and self, manual tasks such as the production of domestic items, and recreational activities including tobacco smoking and hunting. By assessing indicators of quality of life within an institutional framework, namely the supply of local and imported goods and the material culture of recreation, this work is able to explore potential activities of the occupants that are often hidden from official records.

In addition, there is a strong similarity in the nature of those classifications which have been made about types of settlements, general land-use forms, and different retail configurations. While distinct similarities may be found in the methods of these studies, however, in certain important respects parallel lines of enquiry that might have been expected have not been undertaken.

The study focuses on two important dimensions of the self-concept: self-esteem or one's enduring and affective sense of personal value based on accurate self-perception; and self-efficacy, or one's perceptions and assessments of self with regard to competence, effectiveness, and causal agency. It is proposed that African American women's active participation in religious institutions, such as Churches of Christ, that preach and practice patriarchal leadership and an androcentric theology does impact negatively on their self-concept and sense of well-being. One hundred African American women from Churches of Christ in the North east participated in the study. Analyzations of the data suggest that patriarchal leadership in churches of Christ undermines African American women's self-concept and sense of well-being, and that androcentric theology and practices foster negative self-esteem and self-efficacy. Any theology or belief system that has as its goal the exploitation and subordination of African women must be resisted and abolished, or be transformed before they can become vehicles of freedom, and empowerment for African American women. Based on the above findings and conclusions of this study, it is recommended that religious institutions, within the black community, abandon androcentric doctrines that insist on the continued domination and subordination of our black sisters; instead mutuality and equality must replace the ""old-boy's club"" mentality. African American women must share in the leadership role and theological discourses of their local churches. Their stories must be told from their unique perspectives. Mental health professionals must also be cognizant of the importance of the Church or spirituality in the daily experiences of African American women. They must also, however, be ready to help these women come to terms with the pathological and maladaptive aspects of their religious commitments and investments. And there needs to be an on-going debate as well as future research on the impact of patriarchal leadership on the self-concept and psychological well-being of African American women.","","2022-10-06 22:14:21","2022-10-06 22:14:21","2022-10-06 22:14:21","","94","","","","","","","","","","The Union Institute","United States -- Ohio","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780591207095","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology; Philosophy; religion and theology; Church of Christ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Systemic Operational Design gains and maintains the cognitive initiative by enabling the operational commander to recognize and exploit emerging opportunities through its unique process of iterative design. This monograph began as an investigation to determine if either Effects-Based Operations or Systemic Operational Design should replace the traditional Military Decision-Making Process. It soon became clear that these approaches do not accomplish the same functions, are not applicable at the same levels, and are not mutually exclusive. The Military Decision-Making Process originated as a tactical decision-making process, and it remains the most appropriate of the three approaches at that level. It deals with the physical threat on the ground with a decisiveness enabled by an organization of hierarchical authority. Effects-Based Operations is suitable only at the operational level. It takes the time to model the threat as a holistic system and contemplates the desired behavior changes various actions on that system would produce. It exceeds the physical realm of the tactical and explicitly translates strategic directives into tactical effects. Systemic Operational Design is a holistic approach that introduces the discrete element of design to inform planning. It is abstract and conceptual. It creates a cognitive map and continually updates it by the learning that occurs through action. Fusing Systemic Operational Design with the Military Decision-Making Process might be the best way ahead for operational planning and design.","","2022-10-06 22:15:10","2022-10-06 22:15:10","2022-10-06 22:15:10","","","","","","","Systemic Operational Design (SOD)","","","","","","","en","","","","","apps.dtic.mil","","Section: Technical Reports","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"ZUEM82QP","thesis","","de Koning, Free","Spatially Explicit Analysis of Land Use Change : a Case Study for Ecuador","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2564078848/abstract/61F5510CE5694268PQ/1","Introduction and objectives Within agricultural research increasing attention is paid to the integrated study of agro-ecosystems in order to address issues related to sustainable food production at the eco-regional level. This has been stimulated by the awareness that the world-wide demand for food will continue to increase while at the same there is high pressure on natural resources needed for food production, such as suitable soils and available water. Human-driven land use change is also relevant for global change because of its influence on greenhouse gas emissions, water and energy balances, and biodiversity. These issues have confronted research with substantive methodological challenges, such as the integration of biophysical and socio-economic disciplines over various spatio-temporal scales, and the development of modelling approaches for the exploration of future changes in land use and their effects. The general objective of this thesis is the analysis of spatial variation and temporal dynamics of agricultural land use systems in order to quantitatively assess the interaction between land use and the natural resource base. This is addressed through three derived objectives. Firstly, the spatial analysis of land use systems with the aim to detect the main biophysical and socio-economic drivers of actual land use at different spatial scales. Secondly, the spatially explicit modelling of near-future land use change dynamics, taking into account the multi-scale structure of actual land use and its drivers. Thirdly, the quantification of possible effects of future land use change on the natural resource base and agricultural production. The study area The study area is the South-American country of Ecuador. Agriculture is important in Ecuador, both for the production of subsistence crops as well as export crops. The country is characterised by a high agro-ecological diversity. A wide variety of climate and soil conditions exist and land use is diverse, with respect to the crops that are grown as well as the technology levels that are used. Agricultural land use is dynamic due to resource degradation, changes in demand for agricultural products, migration, export and import developments, economic developments and sector policies. A number of land use developments are causing serious threats to the natural resource base. Statistical multi-scale analysis of actual land use systems Land use in Ecuador was investigated for the year 1991 by means of statistical analysis with the purpose of deriving quantitative estimates of the relative areas of land use types on the basis of biogeophysical, socio-economic and infrastructural conditions (Chapter 2). The smallest spatial units of investigation were 5 by 5 minute (9.25 x 9.25 km) cells of a geographical grid covering the whole country. Through aggregation of these cells, a total of six artificial aggregation levels was obtained with the aim of analysing spatial scale dependence of land use structure. For all aggregation levels independent multiple regression models were constructed for the estimation of areas within cells of permanent crops, temporary crops, grassland and natural vegetation.The variables used in the regression models were selected from a set of potential land use drivers or their proxies. A spatial stratification was applied by dividing the country into three main eco-regions. The results showed that at higher aggregation levels, the independent variables explained more of the variance in areas of land use types. In most cases, biogeophysical, socio-economic as well as infrastructural variables were important for the explanation of land use. The variables included in the models and their relative importance varied between land use types and eco-regions. Also within one eco-region the model variables varied with aggregation level. The results demonstrated spatial scale dependence of land use drivers. Spatially explicit modelling of land use change dynamics A spatially explicit multi-scale land use change model was explained and demonstrated in Chapter 3. Important inputs for the model were the results of the multi-scale system analysis of Chapter 2. The model consists of two main modules: the demand module and the allocation module. Changes in the national demand for agricultural commodities are estimated with the demand module. The sub-national changes in land use following changes in demand are calculated in a multi-scale allocation module. The finest resolution for which changes were calculated for Ecuador, were the 5 by 5 minute cells. The allocation module takes into account the non-linear complexities of land use systems by dealing with competition between land use types and interconnectivity of landscape elements. Phenomena that operate over large distances like the influence of urban centres, the proximity to infrastructure and migration fluxes are addressed. The allocation of land use changes was validated by modelling backwards from the year 1991 to the year 1974, a year for which an independent data set was available. The validation results showed a rather good agreement with actual land use data at the level of administrative units called cantons. A hypothetical future base-line scenario of increasing demands for agricultural commodities was used to demonstrate how dynamics of land use are modelled. The results indicated ""hot-spots"", areas with potentially highly dynamic land use change where impacts of land use change on the natural resource base can be expected. Nutrient balances as indicators of sustainability Using a nutrient balance model, inputs and outputs of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were estimated for each cell for the main land use types for the year 1991 (Chapter 4). Inputs considered were mineral fertiliser, organic fertiliser, atmospheric deposition, biological N-fixation and sedimentation; outputs considered were harvested product, removed crop residues, leaching, gaseous losses and erosion. The outcomes for cells were aggregated to sub-national and national level. In general, the estimates showed a depletion of the soil nutrient stock in Ecuadorian agro-ecosystems. Nationally, for temporary crops there was mainly a deficit of nitrogen (42 kg ha -1yr -1), while for permanent crops both nitrogen and potassium balances were clearly negative (40 and 25 kg ha -1yr -1, respectively). For grassland overall, losses are smaller. Erosion is a major cause of nitrogen loss but leaching and denitrification also contribute significantly. In permanent crops relatively large amounts of potassium leave the agro-ecosystem through harvested products, due to high potassium concentrations in these products and high yields. At sub-national scale, nutrient depletion under current land use is more severe in the Andean region than the coastal region, mainly as a result of higher erosion losses. The Amazon region is still largely unexploited but this study suggests that the current conversion of forest to agricultural land may cause serious nutrient balance problems at a local level. Exploration through scenarios The land use change model for Ecuador was used for the dynamic and spatially explicit exploration of near future agricultural land use changes (Chapter 5). A number of plausible scenarios were formulated for the period until the year 2010. At the national level, different developments in national food demand were defined on the basis of assumptions for population growth, consumption patterns and export developments. At the sub-national level the protection of nature parks and land use restrictions due to land degradation were evaluated with respect to their possible spatial impacts on the land use change dynamics within the country. Under the assumptions of the demand scenarios, the area agricultural land expanded significantly, resulting in more use of land in existing agricultural areas and frontier-type expansion into rather undisturbed natural areas. The patterns of change depended on the increase in demand, competition between land use types, changes in the drivers of land use, and the area of land that was excluded from agricultural use. Soil fertility impacts were considered by linking the results of the nutrient balances calculated in Chapter 4 with the results of the land use change model. The results indicated potential negative effects of land use changes on the soil nutrient balance. It was argued that quantification of land use dynamics at the landscape level can support research and policy aimed at understanding the drivers of land use change and the behaviour of complex agro-ecosystems under changing conditions at different spatial scales. This way, issues dealing with sustainable food production and the management of the natural resource base can be addressed in a more integrated and quantitative manner. Spatial and temporal characterisation of Andean potato production systems Chapter 6 described how a statistical analysis of the spatial structure of cropping systems can be combined with the land use change model in order to characterise a specific cropping system. The method was applied for potato production systems in the Ecuadorian Andes. The variation of areas and yields of potato was analysed on the basis of the data for the grid-cells. The results showed a large spatial variability in conditions of potato production systems. The combinations of biophysical and socio-economic variables that best explained the spatial structure of potato areas as well as their yields depended on the geographic area analysed. The whole Andean region was analysed, as well as the provinces Carchi and Chimborazo. Output of the land use change model was used to evaluate the position of potato production systems within the general dynamics of the main land use types. In this way, areas were located where pressure on potato production systems is probable, due to expansion of other agricultural land uses in response to increasing national food demands. Especially competition with grasslands is expected in the near future.When potato-growing areas are pushed into marginal areas, this is likely to have negative consequences for potato productivity. With the results a typology can be given of production systems in relation to their environment. Such information can be used to direct agro-ecological research at specific interactions between environment and crop management. Conclusions - A multi-scale system analysis demonstrated scale dependence of Ecuadorian land use. - The results of the multi-scale system analysis could be integrated in a spatially explicit, dynamic, land use change model. - Scenarios studies with the model allowed for the exploration of possible future land use changes. - The quantitative, spatially explicit, information on land use changes generated by the model offers possibilities for the assessment of the effects of land use change on sustainability of food production, biodiversity and global climate change. - Priorities in further methodology development are linkage with geophysical landscape processes and a better incorporation of crop specific management. Alternate abstract: Introductie en doelstellingen In het landbouwkundig onderzoek wordt in toenemende mate aandacht besteed aan de integrale studie van agro-ecosystemen, in relatie tot duurzaamheidaspecten van voedselproductie op eco-regionaal niveau. Deze aandacht wordt gestuurd door de vaststelling dat de wereldwijde vraag naar voedsel zal blijven toenemen, terwijl er tegelijkertijd sprake is van een een sterke druk op natuurlijke hulpbronnen, zoals geschikte bodems en beschikbaar water. Veranderingen in landgebruik door menselijk handelen zijn van belang voor mondiale milieuveranderingen vanwege hun invloed op de emissies van broeikasgassen, op water- en energiebalansen, en op biodiversiteit. Deze thema's hebben het onderzoek geconfronteerd met methodologische uitdagingen, zoals de integratie van biofysische en sociaal-economische disciplines over verschillende tijdschalen en ruimtelijke schalen, en de ontwikkeling van modelbenaderingen voor de verkenning van de toekomstige veranderingen in landgebruik en de effecten daarvan. De algemene doelstelling van dit proefschrift is de analyse van de ruimtelijke variatie en temporele dynamiek van agrarische landgebruiksystemen, met als doel de interactie tussen landgebruik en de natuurlijke hulpbronnen te kwantificeren. Dit wordt gedaan aan de hand van drie afgeleide doelstellingen. Ten eerste, de ruimtelijke analyse van landgebruiksystemen, om zo de drijvende biogeofysische en sociaal-economische krachten van huidig landgebruik op verschillende ruimtelijke schalen te achterhalen. Ten tweede, het ruimtelijk expliciet modelleren van landgebruikdynamiek in de nabije toekomst, daarbij gebruik makende van kwantitatieve informatie over de drijvende krachten van huidig landgebruik op verschillende ruimtelijke schalen. Ten derde, de kwantificering van de mogelijke effecten van toekomstige landgebruikveranderingen op natuurlijke hulpbronnen en op landbouwproductie. Het studiegebied Het studiegebied is het Zuid-Amerikaanse land Ecuador. Landbouw is in Ecuador belangrijk voor zowel de productie van voedselgewassen als voor de productie van exportgewassen. Het land wordt gekarakteriseerd door een grote agro-ecologische diversiteit. Er bestaat een grote variatie in bodem- en klimaatomstandigheden, en ook het agrarisch landgebruik is divers, zowel wat betreft de gewassen die worden verbouwd als de productietechnieken die worden gebruik. Landgebruik is er dynamisch door de degradatie van natuurlijke hulpbronnen, veranderingen in de vraag naar landbouwproducten, migratie, export- en importontwikkelingen, economische ontwikkelingen en sectorbeleid. Sommige ontwikkelingen in het landgebruik vormen een bedreiging voor de natuurlijke hulpbronnen van het land. Statistische analyse van landgebruiksystemen op verschillende schaalniveaus Landgebruik in Ecuador werd onderzocht voor het jaar 1991 door middel van een statistische analyse. Het doel van de analyse was om kwantitatieve schattingen te geven van de arealen van verschillende landgebruiktypes, op basis van de biogeofysische, socioeconomische en infrastructurele condities (Hoofdstuk 2). De kleinste ruimtelijk eenheden van onderzoek waren cellen ter grootte van 5 bij 5 minuten (9.25 bij 9.25 kilometer) van een geografisch raster dat het hele land besloeg. Door aggregatie van deze cellen werd een totaal van zes kunstmatige aggregatieniveaus verkregen, met als doel de schaalafhankelijkheid van de landgebruikstructuur te analyseren. Voor alle aggregatieniveaus werden onafhankelijke regressiemodellen geconstrueerd voor de schatting van de arealen binnen cellen van meerjarige gewassen, eenjarige gewassen, grasland en natuurlijke vegetatie. De variabelen in de regressiemodellen werden geselecteerd uit een set potentiele (benaderingen van) sturende variabelen. Er werd een ruimtelijke stratificatie uitgevoerd door het land in drie eco-regio's in te delen. Uit de resultaten bleek dat op hogere aggregatieniveaus een groter deel van de variatie in de arealen van de verschillende landgebruiktypes verklaard kon worden. In de meeste gevallen waren zowel biogeofysische, sociaal-economische als infrastructurele variabelen van belang voor de beste verklaring van landgebruik. De variabelen in de regressiemodellen, en hun relatieve bijdrage, hingen af van landgebruiktype en eco-regio. Binnen eco-regio's varieerden de modelvariabelen ook met het aggregatieniveau. De resultaten lieten zien dat er een schaalafhankelijkheid bestaat met betrekking tot de sturende krachten van landgebruik. Ruimtelijk-expliciete modellering van de dynamiek van landgebruik-veranderingen Een ruimtelijk-expliciet landgebruikverandering-model voor meerdere schaalniveaus werd beschreven en gedemonstreerd in Hoofdstuk 3. Belangrijke invoergegevens voor het model waren de resultaten van de systeemanalyse op verschillende schaalniveaus van Hoofdstuk 2. Het model bestaat uit twee hoofdmodules, de vraag-module en de allocatiemodule. Veranderingen in de nationale vraag naar voedsel wordt geschat met de vraagmodule. De sub-nationale veranderingen in landgebruik als gevolg van veranderingen in de vraag worden berekend in de allocatie-module voor verschillende schaalniveaus. De hoogste resolutie waarvoor veranderingen werden uitgerekend voor Ecuador waren de cellen van 5 bij 5 minuten. De allocatie-module incorporeert non-lineaire complexiteit van landgebruiksystemen, door rekening te houden met competitie tussen verschillende landgebruiktypes en met de verbondenheid van ruimtelijk distante landschapselementen. Processen die over grote afstanden effect hebben, zoals de invloed van urbane centra, de nabijheid van infrastructuur, en migratie, kunnen worden meegenomen. De allocatie van landgebruikveranderingen werd gevalideerd door vanaf het jaar 1991 terug te modelleren naar het jaar 1974, een jaar waarvoor een onafhankelijke gegevensset beschikbaar was. De resultaten van de validatie lieten een goede overeenkomst van de modelberekeningen met de werkelijke landgebruikgegevens zien op het niveau van kantons (administratieve eenheden). Een hypothetisch basisscenario voor de nabije toekomst werd gebruikt om te demonstreren hoe de dynamiek van landgebruik wordt gemodelleerd. De resultaten geven een indicatie van de zogenaamde 'hot-spots', plaatsen waar een grote landgebruikdynamiek waarschijnlijk is, en waar effecten op de natuurlijke hulpbronnen te verwachten zijn. Nutrientenbalansen ah indicators voor duurzaamheid Met een nutrientenbalans-model werden voor elke rastercel de aanvoer en afvoer van stikstof, fosfor en kalium geschat voor de belangrijkste landgebruiktypes voor het jaar 1991 (Hoofdstuk 4). De aanvoerposten van de nutrientenbalans die in beschouwing werden genomen waren: kunstmest, organische mest, atmosferische depositie, biologische stikstoffixatie en sedimentatie. De afvoerposten betroffen: geoogst product, afgevoerde gewasresten, uitspoeling, vervluchtiging en erosie. De resultaten werden geaggregeerd tot sub-nationaal en nationaal niveau. In het algemeen lieten de schattingen een afname van de nutrientenvoorraad zien voor Ecuadoraanse agro-ecosystemen. Op nationaal niveau was er voor eenjarige gewassen vooral een tekort van stikstof (42 kg ha-1 jr-1 ), terwijl voor meerjarige gewassen zowel de stikstofbalans als kaliumbalans duidelijk negatief waren (respectievelijk 40 en 25 kg ha-1 jr-1 ). Voor grasland waren de verliezen kleiner. Erosie is een belangrijke verliespost voor stikstof, maar ook uitspoeling en vervluchtiging kunnen van belang zijn. In meerjarige gewassen worden naar verhouding grote hoeveelheden kalium afgevoerd met het geoogste product, door de hoge kaliumconcentraties in die producten en de relatief hoge opbrengsten. Op sub-nationaal niveau zijn de nutrientverliezen bij het huidige landgebruik sterker in de Andes dan in het kustregio, voornamelijk door grotere verliezen via erosie. Het grootste deel van het Amazone-gebied wordt vooralsnog niet geexploiteerd, maar deze studie suggereert dat de in gang zijnde conversie van bos naar landbouwgrond ernstige consequenties kan hebben voor bodemvruchtbaarheid op lokaal niveau. Verkenningen met scenarios Het landgebruikverandering-model voor Ecuador werd gebruikt voor een dynamische en ruimtelijk-expliciete verkenning van agrarische landgebruikveranderingen in de nabije toekomst (Hoofdstuk 5). Een aantal plausibele scenario's werd geformuleerd voor de periode tot het jaar 2010. Op nationaal niveau werden verschillende ontwikkelingen met betrekking tot nationale voedselvraag geformuleerd op basis van aannames voor bevolkingsgroei, consumptiepatronen en export-ontwikkelingen. Op sub-nationaal niveau werden de bescherming van natuurparken en landgebruikbeperkingen als gevolg van bodemdegradatie geevalueerd met betrekking tot hun mogelijke ruimtelijke consequenties voor de landgebruikdynamiek in het land. Onder de aannames van de vraag-scenario's nam het totale landbouwareaal duidelijk toe, hetgeen resulteerde in uitbreiding in bestaande landbouwgebieden en expansie in gebieden met een relatief ongestoorde natuurlijke vegetatie. De gemodelleerde patronen van veranderend landgebruik hingen af van de toename in vraag, de competitie tussen verschillende landgebruiktypes, veranderingen in de sturende krachten van landgebruik, en de oppervlakte land dat werd uitgesloten voor agrarisch gebruik. De effecten op bodemvruchtbaarheid werden bepaald door de uitkomsten van de nutrientenbalans beschreven in Hoofdstuk 4, te relateren aan de resultaten van het landgebruikverandering-model. De resultaten gaven de negatieve effecten aan die landgebruikveranderingen kunnen hebben op de bodemvruchtbaarheid. Er werd bediscussieerd dat de kwantificering van landgebruikdynamiek onderzoek en beleid kan ondersteunen dat is gericht op het begrip van de sturende krachten van landgebruikveranderingen en het gedrag van complexe agro-ecosystemen onder veranderende omstandigheden op verschillende ruimtelijke schalen. Op die manier kunnen kwesties, gerelateerd aan duurzame voedselproductie en management van natuurlijke hulpbronnen, op een meer kwantitatieve en gei'ntegreerde manier onderzocht worden. Ruimtelijke en temporele karakterisering van aardappel-produktiesystemen in de Andes Een statistische analyse van de ruimtelijke structuur van teeltsystemen kan worden gecombineerd met het landgebruikverandering-model om een bepaald teeltsysteem te karakteriseren. De methode werd toegepast voor aardappel-produktiesystemen in het Andesgebergte van Ecuador (Hoofdstuk 6). De variatie in aardappelarealen en aardappelopbrengsten werd geanalyseerd op basis van de data voor de rastercellen. De resultaten lieten een grote ruimtelijke variatie zien in de condities van aardappel-produktiesystemen. De combinaties van biofysische en sociaal-economische variabelen die de ruimtelijke structuur van aardappelarealen en aardappelopbrengsten het best verklaarden waren afhankelijk van het geografische gebied dat werd geanalyseerd. De gehele Andes-regio werd geanalyseerd, en tevens de provincies Carchi en Chimborazo. De uitkomsten van het landgebruikverandering-model werden gebruikt om de positie van aardappelproduktiesystemen te evalueren binnen de algemene dynamiek van de belangrijkste landgebruiktypes. Op deze manier werden de gebieden gelokaliseerd waar aardappelproduktiesystemen onder druk kunnen komen staan als gevolg van expansie van andere agrarische landgebruikvormen in reactie op toenemende voedselvraag. Vooral competitie met grasland wordt verwacht in de nabije toekomst. Als aardappelproduktie meer in marginale gebieden plaats gaat vinden zal dit negatieve gevolgen hebben voor de productiviteit van de aardappelteelt. Met zulke resultaten kan een typologie gegeven worden van produktiesystemen in relatie tot hun omgeving. Deze informatie kan gebruikt worden om agro-ecologisch onderzoek te richten op specifieke interacties tussen omgeving en gewasmanagement. Conclusies - Een systeemanalyse op verschillende schalen liet zien dat landgebruik in Ecuador schaalafhankelijk is. - De resultaten van de systeemanalyse op verschillende ruimtelijke schalen konden worden geintegreerd in een ruimtelijk expliciet dynamisch landgebruikveranderingmodel. - Met het model konden toekomstige landgebruikveranderingen worden verkend door middel van scenario's - De door het model gegenereerde kwantitatieve en ruimtelijk expliciete informatie over landgebruikveranderingen biedt mogelijkheden voor het vaststellen van effecten van landgebruikveranderingen op de duurzaamheid van voedselproductie, op biodiversiteit en op mondiale milieuveranderingen. - Prioriteiten voor verdere methodologie-ontwikkeling zijn het maken van een functionele verbinding met geofysische landschapmodellen en het incorporeren van gewasspecifiek management. Alternate abstract: Introduction y objetivos Dentro de la investigation agricola existe un creciente interes por los estudios integrales de agro-ecosistemas, para tratar la problematica relacionada a la production sostenible de alimentos al nivel eco-regional. Este interes ha estado estimulado por la conciencia que la demanda alimentaria mundial continuara creciendo, mientras a la vez, se ha ejercido alta presion sobre los recursos naturales necesitados para la production de los alimentos, tales como suelos aptos y agua disponible. El cambio que la actividad humana ha implicado para el uso de la tierra tambien ha sido relevante en el cambio global; por su influencia en la emision de gases invernadero, balance de agua y energia, y biodiversidad. Estos problemas han confrontado a la investigation con desafios metodologicos substantivos, tales como la integration de disciplinas biofisicas y socio-economicas a varias escalas espacio-temporales, y el desarrollo de enfoques de modelacion para la exploration de los cambios futuros del uso de la tierra y sus efectos. El objetivo general de esta tesis es analizar la variation espacial y la dinamica temporal de los sistemas de uso agricola de la tierra, para evaluar cuantitativamente la interaction entre el uso de la tierra con los recursos naturales. Hay tres objetivos derivados: Primero, el analisis espacial de los sistemas de uso de la tierra, para detectar las principales fuerzas directrices biofisicas y socio-economicas del uso actual de tierra, a diversas escalas espaciales. Segundo, la modelacion espacialmente explicita de la dinamica del cambio del uso de la tierra a futuro mediato, considerando la estructura de escala multiple del uso actual de la tierra y sus directrices. Tercero, la cuantificacion de los efectos posibles del cambio del uso de la tierra futuro, para los recursos naturales y la production agricola. El area del estudio El area de estudio es el pais Sudamericano, Ecuador. La agriculture es importante en Ecuador, tanto para la production de cultivos de subsistencia, como para cultivos de exportation. El pais esta caracterizado por una alta diversidad agro-ecologica. Existe una amplia variedad climatica y de las condiciones del suelo, y el uso agricola de tierra es diverso (con respecto a los cultivos sembrados, asi como a los niveles de tecnologia utilizados). El uso de la tierra es dinamico debido a la degradation de los recursos, a los cambios en la demanda de productos agricolas, a la migration, al desarrollo de las exportaciones y de las importaciones, a la influencia de la economia y de las politicas sectoriales. Una serie de eventos en el uso de la tierra causa amenazas serias a los recursos naturales. Andlisis estadistico de escala multiple de los sistemas actuates de uso de la tierra Se investigo el uso de la tierra en Ecuador del ano 1991, con analisis estadisticos para derivar estimaciones cuantitativas de areas relativas de los diferentes tipos de uso de la tierra, en base a condiciones bio-geofisicas, socio-economicas y de infraestructura (capitulo 2). Las unidades espaciales minimas de investigation fueron celdas de 5 por 5 minutos (9,25 x 9,25 km) de una rejilla geografica que cubrio el pais entero. A partir de la agregacion de estas celdas, se obtuvo un total de seis niveles artificiales de agregacion para analizar la dependencia de la escala espacial de la estructura del uso de la tierra. Para todos los niveles de agregacion, se construyo modelos independientes de regresion multiple para estimar las areas dentro de las celdas de cultivos permanentes, cultivos temporales, pastos y vegetation natural. Las variables utilizadas en los modelos de regresion fueron seleccionadas de un grupo de direcctrices potenciales (o sus aproximaciones) del uso de la tierra. Se estratifico espacialmente al pais en tres ecoregiones principales. Los resultados mostraron que a niveles mas altos de agregacion, las variables independientes explicaron mejor la variation entre las areas de cada tipo de uso de la tierra. En la mayoria de casos, variables bio-geofisicas, socioeconomics, asi como de infraestructura fueron importantes para explicar el uso de la tierra. Las variables incluidas en los modelos y su importancia relativa variaron segun los tipos de uso de la tierra y segun las eco-regiones. Dentro de cada eco-region las variables del modelo tambien variaron segun los niveles de agregacion. Los resultados demostraron dependencia de las escalas espaciales de las fuerzas direcctrices del uso de la tierra. Modelacion espacialmente explicita de la dindmica en el uso de la tierra En el capitulo 3 se dilucido un modelo espacialmente explicito, de escala multiple del cambio de uso de la tierra. Las entradas de information importantes para este modelo, fueron los resultados del analisis de escala mutiple del sistema explicado en el capitulo 2. El modelo consiste de dos modulos principales: el de demanda y el de asignacion. Con el modulo de demanda, se estiman los cambios de la demanda nacional de los productos agricolas; con el modulo de asignacion de escala multiple, se calculan los cambios subnacionales de uso de la tierra, resultantes de los cambios nacionales de demanda. La resolution minima con la que los cambios para Ecuador se calcularon, fue la rejilla de celdas 5 por 5 minutos. El modulo de asignacion toma en cuenta las complejidades no lineares de sistemas de uso de la tierra, al considerar la competencia entre los tipos de uso de la tierra y la interconnexion de los elementos del paisaje. El modelo toma en cuenta fenomenos que operan sobre distancias grandes, tales como la influencia de centros urbanos, la proximidad a la infraestructura y los flujos de migration. La asignacion de los cambios del uso de la tierra fue validada por modelacion retroactiva desde el afto 1991 hasta el afio 1974 (ano para el cual se obtuvo datos independientes). Los resultados de la validation mostraron alta concordancia con datos reales de uso de la tierra, al nivel de las unidades administrativas cantonales. Un escenario base, futuro e hipotetico del aumento de la demanda de insumos agricolas fue utilizado para demostrar como las dinamicas del uso de la tierra son modeladas. Los resultados determinaron la existencia de ""areas claves"", donde potencialmente el uso de la tierra es altamente dinamico, y los impactos del cambio del uso de la tierra en los recursos naturales pueden ser previsibles. Balance de nutrientes como indicadores de sostenibilidad Con un modelo del balance de nutrientes se calculo por cada celda las entradas y las salidas de nitrogeno, fosforo y potasio para los tipos principales de uso de la tierra en el afio 1991 (capitulo 4). Las entradas consideradas fueron: fertilizante mineral y organico, deposition atmosferica, fijacion biologica de N y sedimentation. Las salidas consideradas fueron: productos cosechados, remocion de residuos de cosechas, lixiviacion, perdidas gaseosas y erosion. Los resultados de las celdas fueron agregados al nivel sub-nacional y nacional. En general, las estimaciones mostraron un agotamiento de la provision de nutrientes del suelo en los agro-ecosistemas ecuatorianos. Al nivel nacional, se obtuvo que en los cultivos temporales hay principalmente un deficit de nitrogeno (42 kg ha-1 ano-1 ), mientras que para los cultivos permanentes los balances, tanto de nitrogeno como de potasio, son claramente negativos (40 y 25 kg ha-1 ano-1 , respectivamente). Para el total de pastos las perdidas son mas pequenas. La erosion es una causa importante de la perdida de nitrogeno, pero la lixiviacion y la desnitrificacion tambien contribuyen significativamente. En cultivos permanentes, relativamente grandes cantidades de potasio salen del agro-ecosistema en forma de productos cosechados, debido a las altas concentraciones de potasio en tales productos, y rendimientos relativamente altos. En la escala sub-nacional, el agotamiento de nutrientes bajo el uso actual de tierra es mas severo en la region andina que en la region costera, principalmente como resultado de perdidas por erosion. La region amazonica sigue siendo en gran parte aun inexplotada, pero este estudio sugiere que la conversion actual del bosque en areas de uso agricola, podria causar problemas serios en el balance de nutrientes al nivel local. Exploration a troves de escenarios El modelo de cambio de uso de la tierra foe utilizado para la exploration dinamica y espacialmente explicita de los cambios en el foturo cercano del uso de la tierra en Ecuador (capitulo 5). Un numero de escenarios plausibles foe formulado para un periodo que cubre hasta el ano 2010. Al nivel nacional, diversos incrementos de la demanda alimenticia foeron definidos en base de las presunciones del crecimiento de la poblacion, patrones de consumo y desarrollo de las exportaciones. Se evaluo al nivel sub-nacional la protection de los parques naturales y las restricciones en el uso de la tierra por degradation, con respecto a sus posibles impactos espaciales en la dinamica del cambio del uso de la tierra dentro del pais. Bajo las suposiciones de los escenarios demandados, el area de tierra para agricultura se expandio significativamente, resultando en mas usos de tierra en areas agricolas existentes y en la expansion del tipo frontera en areas naturales imperturbadas. Los patrones de cambio dependieron del aumento de la demanda, competencia entre los tipos de uso de la tierra, cambios de las foerzas direcctrices del uso de la tierra, y del area excluida del uso agricola. Al establecer la relation entre el balance de nutrientes calculado en el capitulo 4, con los resultados del modelo de cambio en el uso de la tierra, se pudo considerar el impacto en la fertilidad del suelo. Los resultados indicaron los potenciales efectos negativos de los cambios del uso de la tierra en el balance de los nutrientes del suelo. Se discutio que la cuantificacion de la dinamica del uso de la tierra al nivel del paisaje, puede respaldar la investigation y las politicas dirigidas a entender las direcctrices del cambio del uso de la tierra, y el comportamiento de agro-ecosistemas complejos bajo condiciones cambiantes a diversas escalas espaciales. De esta manera asuntos relacionados a la production sostenible de alimentos y al manejo de los recursos naturales, pueden ser abarcados de una manera mas integrada y cuantitativa. Caracterizacion espacialy temporal de los sistemas de production andinos de papa En el capitulo 6, se explico como un analisis estadistico de la estructura espacial de los sistemas de cultivos, se puede combinar con el modelo de cambio del uso de la tierra para caracterizar a un sistema de production especifico. El metodo foe aplicado para caracterizar la production de papa en los Andes ecuatorianos. La variation de area y rendimiento de papa foe analizada cuantitativamente, con base en los datos de las celdas. Los resultados mostraron una variabilidad espacial grande en las condiciones de los sistemas de production de papa. Diferentes combinaciones de variables bio-geofisicas y socio-economicas explicaron mejor, la estructura espacial del area cultivada con papa, asi como su productividad, dependiendo del area geografica analizada. La region andina en conjunto fue analizada, asi como las provincias de Carchi y Chimborazo. La salida del modelo de cambio de uso de la tierra fue utilizada para evaluar la position de los sistemas de production de papa, dentro de la dinamica general de los tipos principales de uso de la tierra. De esta manera se localizaron areas donde probablemente hay presion sobre los sistemas de production de papa, debido a la expansion de otros usos agricolas de tierra en respuesta a la creciente demanda national de alimentos. De esta manera se localizaron areas donde hay una probable presion sobre sistemas de production de papa, debido a la expansion de otros tipos de uso de tierra, resultando de la creciente demanda national de alimentos. Especialmente se espera competencia con areas dedicadas a pastos. Cuando las areas sembradas con papa sean empujadas hacia areas marginales, seguramente existiran consecuencias negativas para la productividad de papa. Con estos resultados se pude hacer una tipologia de sistemas de production relacionados a su ambiente. Esta information se puede usar para dirigir la investigation agricola hacia interacciones especificas entre medio-ambiente y manejo de cultivos. Conclusiones - El analisis de escala multiple del sistema demostro dependencia de escala especial del uso de la tierra en Ecuador. - Los resultados del analisis de escala multiple se pudieron integrar en un modelo de uso de la tierra explicito y dinamico. - Estudios de escenarios con el modelo permitieron la exploration de los cambios posibles que a futuro podrian haber en el uso de la tierra. - La information cuantitativa y espacialmente explicita, del uso de la tierra generada por el modelo ofrece posibilidades para la valorization del efecto de los cambios en el uso de la tierra en cuanto a sostenebilidad en la production de alimentos, biodiversidad y cambio global del clima. - Las prioridades en posteriores desarrollos de la metodologia estan ligadas a procesos geofisicos del paisaje y a una mejor incorporation de manejo de cultivos especificos.","","2022-10-06 22:15:20","2022-10-06 22:15:20","2022-10-06 22:15:20","","182","","","","","Spatially Explicit Analysis of Land Use Change","","","","","Wageningen University and Research","Netherlands","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798516019050","","","","","Climate change; Geography; Biodiversity; Landscape ecology; Environmental economics; Economics; Natural resources; Agriculture; Land use planning; Land use; Systems analysis; Ecosystems; Ecology; Spatial analysis; System theory; Food; Regions; Agronomy; Area planning & development; Biology; Conservation biology; Crops; Economic conditions; Growth models; Human influences; Investigations; Socioeconomic factors; Soil sciences; Statistical analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we propose, alongside linearity, a quantitative measure for another property of a dominance hierarchy, namely its steepness. Steepness of a hierarchy is defined here as the absolute slope of the straight line fitted to the normalized David's scores (calculated on the basis of a dyadic dominance index corrected for chance) plotted against the subjects' ranks. This correction for chance is an improvement of an earlier proposal by de Vries (appendix 2 in de Vries, Animal Behaviour, 1998, 55, 827–843). In addition, we present a randomization procedure for determining the statistical significance of a hierarchy's steepness, which can be used to test the observed steepness against the steepness expected under the null hypothesis of random win chances for all pairs of individuals. Whereas linearity depends on the number of established binary dominance relationships and the degree of transitivity in these relationships, steepness measures the degree to which individuals differ from each other in winning dominance encounters. Linearity and steepness are complementary measures to characterize a dominance hierarchy.","2006-03-01","2022-10-06 22:15:31","2022-10-06 22:15:31","2022-10-06 22:15:31","585-592","","3","71","","Animal Behaviour","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

People at the hands of the power-hungry face discrimination and are often subjected to extreme violence and abuse. Society has undergone several changes and progressions through time, including economic, political and social changes. One thing that has remained unchanged however, is man‟s power over woman. Patriarchal power is present in all sectors and scenarios of society, from the home to the international legal system.  My study focuses on the notion that an abundance of power leads to fear, violence and total disarray at the micro and macro levels of society. I argue that the essential problem in the relationship between man and woman is not a man‟s abuse of power, but rather that he has too much power in the first place. A culture of entitlement breeds among men, enabling them to treat women as inferior, sub-human objects.  Definitions of male and female prove to be concreted into specific roles and gendered identities within the home and the greater society. People fall automatically into these roles, blindly and unquestioningly. It is for this reason that I maintain all members of society ensure the survival of patriarchy – even if they do so unconsciously. While the difference in the understanding of rape and sexual intercourse should be stark, it is blurred because they are defined according to male terms. Man‟s entitlement allows him to think it his right to take sex from a woman, even if she does not offer it willingly. Culture and tradition serve as major obstacles in any possibility of society‟s progression. Culture has proved such an undisputed order in society that it even trumps the international legal system of human rights. Culture justifies, or at least trivialises, the abuse of women. The social stigmatisation of sexual abuse silences women, providing further endorsement for men to continue asserting their power. A woman‟s life, as determined by male hierarchy, gender bias, culture and social stigmas, is therefore fated. It is with this in mind that I strongly question the progression of society into a true form of liberality and equality. In order for society to attain such a transcended state, it will have to disregard everything that it knows and deconstruct everything that has defined it up to that point. Until this is achieved, women will continue to live their lives in fear of the silent weapon in war and peace.","2012","2022-10-06 22:16:45","2022-10-06 22:16:45","2022-10-06 22:16:45","","","","","","","The silent weapon in war and peace","","","","","University of Pretoria","","en","© 2012 University of Pretoria.

Situations imposing normative constrain can motivate individuals to moderate the expression of their racial attitudes, especially in relation to stereotyping and prejudice. Data was collected from 97 participants living in Hedmark and Oppland, Norway. The purpose of the study was to examine if a correlation between implicit and explicit attitudes exists using a response latency and self-report measurement. Additionally, the presence of normative control was tested using focus group discussions intended at encouraging participant‘s behavioural expressions of their racial attitudes. Three group discussion leaders with different racial backgrounds were used to measure the social control exerted by participants. ANOVA, factor and regression analysis were performed; evidence has been found in support of a correlation between implicit and explicit attitudes. Individuals indicated rather positive attitudes during the self-report measure while simultaneously revealing negative attitudes during the response latency measurement. Compliance to normative contrain was observed during group discussions led by the European and African leader resulting in decreased numbers of negative statements. On the other hand, group discussions led by the Norwegian leader generated decreased saliency for egalitarian values, which in turn resulted in less compliance induced by normative control from participants and an increase of negative statements.","2011","2022-10-06 22:16:58","2022-10-06 22:16:58","2022-10-06 22:16:58","","","","","","","Situational variables and outgroup negativity","","","","","Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet, Fakultet for samfunnsvitenskap og teknologiledelse, Psykologisk institutt","","eng","","Master thesis","","","ntnuopen.ntnu.no","","Accepted: 2014-12-19T14:42:09Z Publication Title: 98","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"ZKKYCQXI","thesis","2014","Debela, Elias Berhanu","The role of micro and small enterprises (MSA) in local economic development (LED), with a focus on the wood-work MSE value chain","","","","","https://uir.unisa.ac.za/handle/10500/14325","This research had an objective of exploring the role of MSEs in LED through analysis of wood-work MSE value chain. The basic research questions underscore what the domestic wood-work value chain looks like; what major weaknesses and challenges confront the operation of MSEs; what major areas of upgrading and inter-firm relations are evident in the sector; and what MSE value chains contribute to LED. The research exercise was based on review of related literature and a field survey, involving MSE operators drawn from the study area (Addis Ababa). Mixed method of analysis (quantitative and qualitative) was employed to deal with the data collected through questionnaires and interviews. Porter’s model of VC (1985) and UNIDO’s description of wood-work VC (2005) were used to provide conceptual framework. The wood-work sub-sector in Ethiopia has a domestic value chain since main inputs are from local sources, designs are by local producers, and products are for domestic markets. Domestic actors govern the allocation of resources and the distribution of benefits. Public enterprises control plantations hence primary inputs. Wholesalers in turn control inputs, which finally reach MSEs through retailers. Design, production and marketing decisions are made by MSE operators. Middlemen are minor as most of the products reach consumers directly. The value-chain’s downstream is thus described by a short distribution-channel. Horizontal, non-market, linkages characterize inter-firm relations; whereas, arm’s length market linkages dominate the supplier-MSE-buyer relations. In the absence of “lead firms”, wood-work MSE value chains fail to qualify for the mainstream “buyer-driven” model. Without buyer-dominated quasi-hierarchical relationship, MSEs exercise “incremental upgrading” through learning-by-doing. Measures taken to upgrade the production process are considerably inclined to the physical (hardware) aspects of the firm. The MSE value-chain is restrained by internal and external problems. The current state of design marks underdeveloped links in the chain and delays entry into competitive markets. Despite the drawbacks, MSEs enable localities mobilize fragmented resources and create employment. MSEs contribute to LED through the value chain, right from input-sourcing to production and marketing. Inter-firm relations and upgrading efforts uphold the contributions.","2014-08","2022-10-06 22:17:50","2022-10-06 22:17:50","2022-10-06 22:17:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","Thesis","","","uir.unisa.ac.za","","Accepted: 2014-11-06T12:11:38Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"FCVKMMNU","thesis","","Cechin, Andrei","Governance of the Member-Cooperative Relationship: A Case from Brazil","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2563681235/abstract/4C93779791CA42ADPQ/1","Recent events in the agri-food sector increased the demand for quality attributes, from healthy and safe products to sustainable agricultural practices (Grunert, 2005). Particularly challenging is the connectedness of transactions between farmers, traders, processors, retailers and final customers in order to comply with quality requirements, which implies a need for value chain coordination. Combined with increased consumer demand for variety and convenience, these changes in sector have led to stronger sequential interdependencies, in which the output of one part is the input for another part. The increasing connectedness between transactions demands more vertical coordination. A major challenge for the agricultural cooperative is to combine horizontal coordination among the members with vertical coordination in the value chain (Bijman 2009; Hanf, 2009). Since they are member-oriented, agricultural cooperatives traditionally buy the farm products of its members regardless of its quality. Increasingly, however, cooperatives need to guarantee product quality towards their customers, and thus assure that members supply products of the right quality. The objective of this thesis is to disentangle the governance mechanisms that can be used by the cooperative to strengthen the member-cooperative relationship, and to assess the impact of the different governance mechanisms on the coordination of members’ adjustments to higher quality levels. The attempt to organize the participating farmers and firms along the food value chain generates transactional risks and coordination costs in the relationship between agricultural cooperative and farmer-member. This leads to the first research question of this thesis. R.Q. (1): What are the mechanisms for governing the member-cooperative relationship, and how do they affect transactional risks and coordination costs? This thesis (Chapter 2) poses that four governance mechanisms - market, hierarchy, community and democracy affect coordination costs and transactional risks through their effect on member commitment and cognitive heterogeneity. It is important that members of an agricultural cooperative are committed to customer orientation; otherwise the involved transactional risks would make vertical coordination more costly. It is necessary to disentangle two types of commitment: to collective action and to customer orientation. Member commitment to collective action prevents side selling, in particular, and free-riding behaviour in general. This leads to the second research question of this thesis. R.Q. (2): How do the four governance mechanisms - market, hierarchy, community and democracy - affect both types of commitment? One of the conclusions stemming from this thesis was that, on the one hand, a cooperative may assure members’ compliance in a less costly way if market incentives related to quality, productivity and effort are strengthened, as well as (hierarchy) input control and on-farm monitoring, since these mechanisms are positively related to commitment to customer orientation. On the other hand, democracy and community mechanisms do have an important role in enhancing commitment to collective action which is a sine qua non condition for the viability of the cooperative (Chapter 3). A large multi-product cooperative in which different activities of the cooperative cater to different groups of members, as the case that was chosen as the empirical basis of this thesis, may face problems related to membership heterogeneity (Hansmann, 1996; Fulton and Giannakas, 2001). The basic assumption in most of the literature on the impact of member heterogeneity on the process and outcomes of decision-making is that farmers pursue individual or subgroup interests when participating in the decision-making of the cooperative. If members primarily pursue individual economic interests, there might be a relationship between the economic reasons for becoming a member (and maintaining membership) and the motivation to participate in the governance of the cooperative. This leads to the third research question of this thesis. R.Q. (3): How do economic motivations for association affect members’ participation in the governance of a cooperative? The conclusion of this thesis, regarding this research question, was that besides the role of social mechanisms in enhancing commitment to collective action, there seems to be a role of social mechanisms in enhancing members’ control of their cooperative. Members who participate in boards or committees are not actuated to participate by the same economic motivations that drive their association to the cooperative. Cooperative ideology, in turn, appears to be an important motivation for them to actively participate (Chapter 4). The ability of cooperatives to adapt to a rapidly changing environment characterized by technological change and industrialization of agriculture has been questioned Fulton (1995). The organizational structure of the cooperative is said to have negative implications for its quality management (Mérel et al., 2009). On the one hand, cooperatives may be mimicking Investor-Owned Firms (IOFs) in applying more hierarchical mechanisms which enable them to define and effectively apply quality norms for their supply, control the quality of delivered products and monitor members’ production processes. On the other hand, cooperatives have unique organizational characteristics that could provide them with competitive advantage, such as the tight relationship between members and cooperative, which may enable less costly coordination of the transaction (Sykuta and Cook, 2001). This leads to the fourth and last research question of this thesis. R.Q. (4): What are the differences in quality performance between a cooperative and an IOF, and can these differences be explained by relationship characteristics? In the Brazilian broiler industry, suppliers delivering to a cooperative are performing better in terms of quality than suppliers delivering to an IOF. Cooperative and IOF have the same incentive and control mechanisms for production efficiency and high-quality chicken meat. The cooperative’s advantage over the IOF in terms of suppliers’ quality performance could be influenced by the characteristics of the supplier-buyer relationship. This thesis shows (Chapter 5) that there are some important differences regarding relationship characteristics that could account for this higher performance. Dependence on current buyer, which is higher for cooperative members, uncertainty regarding buyer’s behavior, which is lower for cooperative members, and market risk reduction by the buyer, which is higher for cooperative members, can help explain the higher rate of compliance to the “feet callus” quality standard. These three features of the supplier-cooperative relationship are likely to prevent suppliers from shirking behavior and to induce commitment. Moreover, cooperative suppliers receive more technical support from their buyer for adapting to new quality requirements than IOF suppliers do; this is likely to positively affect farmers’ competence in complying with quality standards. The main methodological approach of this thesis is quantitative. Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews with professional managers of the industrial division, directors and farmers in order to guide the design of the questionnaire. The data that is analyzed in this thesis were collected by using a survey questionnaire applied among 148 farmers, all members of the same multi-product cooperative in Brazil, and 42 broiler suppliers of two major buyers in the same region. This thesis makes several theoretical contributions, which can be listed as follows: (1) Member commitment in agricultural cooperatives can be disentangled conceptually and empirically into two types. Commitment to collective action is related to Fulton’s (1995) definition: the willingness to patronize a cooperative even when the cooperative’s price or service is not as good as that provided by an IOF. It is an attitude that precedes loyal behaviour; it is the making of a sacrifice or an effort in the name of the relationship and the success of the organization. Commitment to customer orientation, in turn, is the willingness to give up a part of the autonomy at the farm level for the sake of the cooperative’s compliance with the requirements from downstream customers. It is a positive attitude of members towards the re-orientation of the cooperative and is related to Borgen’s (2001) view on commitment (2) Membership heterogeneity might not be a source of inefficiency in decision-making if the organizational goal is precisely to satisfy diverse members’ interests, and if members who occupy representative and managing functions are genuinely seeking to further organizational goals rather than to follow private motives. Most conceptualizations of decision-making problems and influence costs derive from organizational economics, where agency theory has been quite influential. The findings of this thesis (Chapter 4) suggest that assumptions from agency theory, which are often adopted by cooperative studies, could better be treated as an empirical matter. (3) This thesis presents a different perspective on the comparative advantage of the cooperative in producing food products with higher quality attributes. The literature on the implications of the cooperative structure for quality management (Mérel et al., 2009) emphasizes that cooperatives often fail to adequately reward the highest quality producers, often causing the problem of “adverse selection”. However, despite starting with larger heterogeneity in terms of producers’ capacity to produce high-quality products, cooperatives may achieve high quality products through superior coordination and adaptation support. The findings of this thesis are in line with other empirical studies outside the domain of cooperatives that found that quality performance may be influenced by relationship characteristics, through their effect on transaction costs (Lu et al., 2009; Coronado et al., 2010). (4) Overall, the main scientific contribution of this thesis is the use of the ‘chemistry of organizations’ framework proposed by Grandori and Furnari (2008) in seeking a better understanding of the governance of cooperatives. By adopting that framework the thesis addressed in an integrated way the role of social capital (Ostrom, 1999) and community governance (Bowles and Gintis, 2002; Hayami, 2009) in facilitating collective action, and the role of relational contracts (Poppo and Zenger, 2002; Lazzarini, Miller and Zenger, 2004) in assuring commitment from parties in a transaction. Furthermore, with that framework, the thesis addressed the cognitive role of governance mechanisms, such as knowledge exchange (Conner and Prahalad, 1996; Grant, 1996) and competence enhancing (Nooteboom, 2004). The implications of this thesis for management and policy are listed in the three following groups: (1) Rewarding farmers appropriately and controlling and monitoring delivery and production processes are important for enhancing commitment both to collective action and to customer orientation. Giving “voice” and building a social community for members and their families are important to prevent members’ free-riding and selling “outside”. It is advised to combine at least the following governance mechanisms: hierarchy control, market incentives, community involvement and democratic voice. Finally, communication is an important tool for enhancing farmers’ commitment to customer orientation. (2) Cooperatives can participate in high-quality value chains and be as efficient and effective as other organizational arrangements in the agri-food sector. More importantly, cooperatives might even have an advantage in the production and marketing of goods with credence attributes, such as animal welfare, organic and fair trade. Therefore, policies aiming to promote sustainable food production may target cooperatives, as this organisational form is more effective in lowering the risks associated with farmer’ opportunistic behavior. (3) Member participation, commitment, satisfaction with leadership and with the cooperative’s strategy are examples of what could be additional performance criteria besides reported profits, which taken alone could be misleading. Because the cooperative’s objectives are beyond the economic viability of the collective enterprise, (Birchall and Ketilson, 2009), the intangible social assets should be assessed in order to evaluate the performance of the cooperative, and thereby to compare cooperatives with investor-owned firms and among cooperatives themselves. Alternate abstract: Huidige ontwikkelingen in the agri-food sector verhogen de vraag naar kwaliteit van producten, van gezonde en veilige producten tot duurzame landbouwpraktijken (Grunert, 2005). Voldoen aan kwaliteitseisen van consumenten, overheid en bedrijven, vraagt om versterking van de relaties tussen boeren, handelaren, verwerkers, en retailers Met andere woorden, dit vraagt om ketencoördinatie, oftewel verticale coördinatie. Gecombineerd met een toegenomen consumentenvraag naar variatie en gemak hebben deze veranderingen geleid tot sterkere wederzijdse afhankelijkheid tussen opeenvolgende schakels van de keten, waarbij het eindproduct van de ene schakel het beginproduct voor de volgende vormt. Daarmee staat de landbouwcoöperatie staat voor de uitdaging om horizontale coördinatie tussen leden te combineren met verticale coördinatie in de keten (Bijman 2009; Hanf, 2009). Vanuit haar ledenoriëntatie koopt een landbouwcoöperatie van oudsher alle producten van haar leden ongeacht de kwaliteit. Echter, coöperaties moeten in toenemende mate de productkwaliteit garanderen richting klanten en moeten daarom zich ervan verzekeren dat haar leden de producten in de juiste kwaliteit aanleveren. De doelstelling van dit proefschrift is enerzijds om de sturingsmechanismen te ontrafelen die een coöperatie kan gebruiken om de relatie met haar leden te versterken en anderzijds om de impact van de verschillende sturingsmechanismen op kwaliteitsverbetering te analyseren. Elke transactie tussen verkopers en kopers, en dus ook tussen boeren en hun coöperatie, brengt transactierisico’s en coördinatiekosten met zich mee. Dit leidt tot de eerste onderzoeksvraag van dit proefschrift. (1) Wat zijn de mechanismen voor sturing van de transactie tussen leden en de coöperatie en hoe beïnvloeden deze mechanismen transactierisico’s en coördinatiekosten? Hoofdstuk 2 van dit proefschrift stelt dat de vier ideaaltypische sturingsmechanismen – markt, hiërarchie, gemeenschap en democratie – de coördinatiekosten en transactierisico’s beïnvloeden via hun effect op betrokkenheid van leden en cognitieve heterogeniteit. Het is belangrijk dat leden van een landbouwcoöperatie zich committeren aan klantgerichtheid omdat anders de transactierisico’s te hoog worden. Het is noodzakelijk om twee typen betrokkenheid te onderscheiden, die bij collectieve actie en die bij een klantgerichte strategie. Betrokkenheid bij collectieve actie voorkomt verkoop buiten de coöperatie om en meer algemeen meelift-gedrag. Dit leidt tot de tweede onderzoeksvraag van dit proefschrift. (2) Hoe beïnvloeden de vier sturingsmechanismen – markt, hiërarchie, gemeenschap en democratie – betrokkenheid bij collectieve actie en betrokkenheid bij een klantgerichte strategie? Een van de conclusies van dit proefschrift (hoofdstuk 3) is dat een coöperatie geen hoge kosten hoeft te maken om naleving door leden van kwaliteitsafspraken af te dwingen, omdat individuele economisch prikkels, het controleren van gebruik van inputs en het monitoren van activiteiten op de boerderij positief gerelateerd zijn aan ledenbetrokkenheid bij een klantgerichte strategie. Daarnaast, hebben de mechanismen van democratie en gemeenschap een belangrijke rol in het bevorderen van betrokkenheid bij collectieve actie, een sine qua non voorwaarde voor de levensvatbaarheid van een coöperatie. Volgens de literatuur ondervindt een grote coöperatie die zich kenmerkt door meerdere producten en verschillende activiteiten gericht op verschillende groepen leden problemen gerelateerd aan de heterogeniteit van het ledenbestand (Hansmann, 1996; Fulton en Giannakas, 2001). Het uitgangspunt in de meeste literatuur over de invloed van heterogeniteit op het proces en de uitkomsten van de besluitvorming is dat boeren streven naar individuele of subgroepbelangen wanneer zij deelnemen aan de besluitvorming van de coöperatie. Als leden voornamelijk individuele economische belangen nastreven, is er mogelijk een verband tussen de economische motieven om lid te worden (en te blijven) en de motivatie om deel te nemen aan het bestuur van de coöperatie. Dit leidt tot de derde onderzoeksvraag van dit proefschrift. (3) Hoe beïnvloeden de economische drijfveren om te lid worden de deelname van de leden aan het besturen van een coöperatie? De conclusie van dit proefschrift (hoofdstuk 4), met betrekking tot deze onderzoeksvraag, was dat naast de rol van de sociale mechanismen bij het vergroten van betrokkenheid bij collectieve actie, er een rol lijkt te zijn voor sociale mechanismen in het versterken van de controle van leden over hun coöperatie. Leden die deelnemen aan bestuur of commissies doen dit niet vanuit dezelfde economische motieven die hen lid maken van de coöperatie. Coöperatieve ideologie blijkt een belangrijke motivatie voor hen om actief deel te nemen aan besluitvorming. Het vermogen van coöperaties om zich aan te passen aan een snel veranderende omgeving die wordt gekenmerkt door technologische veranderingen en de industrialisatie van de landbouw is in twijfel getrokken door Fulton (1995). Aan de organisatiestructuur van de coöperatie worden negatieve gevolgen voor management van kwaliteit toegeschreven (Merel et al., 2009). Aan de ene kant kunnen coöperaties de Investor-Owned Firms (IOFs) nabootsen in het toepassen van meer hiërarchische mechanismen die hen in staat stellen kwaliteitsnormen voor de productieprocessen van haar leden definiëren en effectief toe te passen op hun aanbod, de kwaliteit van de geleverde producten te controleren en te bewaken. Aan de andere kant, hebben coöperaties unieke organisatiekenmerken die mogelijk een concurrentievoordeel opleveren, zoals de nauwe relatie tussen de leden en de coöperatie, die minder kostbare coördinatie van de transactie vergt (Sykuta en Cook, 2001). Dit leidt tot de vierde en laatste onderzoeksvraag van dit proefschrift. (4) Wat zijn de verschillen in kwaliteit van de prestaties tussen een coöperatie en een IOF, en kunnen deze verschillen worden verklaard uit verschillen in relatiekenmerken? In de Braziliaanse vleeskuikenindustrie presteren boeren die leveren aan een coöperatie beter in termen van kwaliteit dan boeren die leveren aan een IOF. Coöperatie en IOF hanteren dezelfde economische prikkels en controlemechanismen voor de productie-efficiëntie van hoogwaardig kippenvlees. Het voordeel van de coöperatie ten opzichte van de IOF in termen van kwaliteitsbevordering, is gelegen in de kenmerken van de leverancier-afnemer relatie. Dit proefschrift laat zien (hoofdstuk 5) dat er een aantal belangrijke verschillen met betrekking tot de relationele kenmerken zijn die verantwoordelijk zouden kunnen zijn voor deze hogere prestaties. De mate van afhankelijkheid van de koper, welke hoger is voor leden van de coöperatie dan voor de leveranciers van een IOF, de onzekerheid over het gedrag van de koper, welke lager is voor leden van de coöperatie, en de reductie van marktrisico van de koper, welke groter is voor leden van de coöperatie, helpen de hogere mate van naleving van de kwaliteitsnorm te verklaren. Deze drie kenmerken van de relatie tussen boer en coöperatie voorkomen waarschijnlijk lijntrek-gedrag door de boeren en vergoten betrokkenheid. Bovendien krijgen de boeren die leveren aan de coöperatie meer technische steun van hun koper voor aanpassing aan nieuwe kwaliteitseisen dan leveranciers aan de IOF. Dit heeft waarschijnlijk een positieve invloed op de deskundigheid van boeren bij het voldoen aan kwaliteitsnormen. De belangrijkste methodologische aanpak van dit proefschrift is kwantitatief; gegevens werden verzameld via een vragenlijst onder 148 boeren die allemaal lid zijn van dezelfde multi-product coöperatie in Brazilië, alsmede onder 42 vleeskuikenleveranciers van twee grote afnemers in dezelfde regio. Daarnaast werden kwalitatieve gegevens verzameld door middel van semi-gestructureerde interviews met professionele managers van de coöperatie, met bestuurders en met boeren om het ontwerp van de vragenlijst te begeleiden. Dit proefschrift maakt een aantal theoretische bijdragen, die als volgt kunnen worden opgesomd: (1) De betrokkenheid van boeren bij hun coöperatie kan conceptueel en empirisch ontrafelt worden in twee soorten. Betrokkenheid bij collectieve actie is, volgens de definitie van Fulton (1995): de bereidheid om bij de coöperatie te blijven, zelfs wanneer de prijs of de dienst van de coöperatie niet zo goed is als die van een IOF. Betrokkenheid is een houding die voorafgaat aan loyaliteit; het offer in naam van de relatie zelf en het succes van de organisatie. Echter, betrokkenheid bij een klantgerichte strategie betekent dat de boer de bereidheid heeft om een deel van de autonomie van het landbouwbedrijf op te geven in het belang van de naleving van de eisen van de klanten van de coöperatie. Het is een positieve houding van de leden ten aanzien van de heroriëntatie van de coöperatie. (2) Heterogeniteit van het ledenbestand zou geen bron van inefficiëntie in de besluitvorming hoeven zijn als het organisatorische doel juist is om de belangen van heterogene leden te behartigen, en als leden die representatieve en managementfuncties bezetten daadwerkelijk streven naar verbetering van organisatorische doelen in plaats van individuele doelen. De meeste conceptualiseringen van de besluitvormingsproblemen en invloedkosten zijn gebaseerd op economische organisatietheorie, waar de agency-theorie vrij invloedrijk is geweest. Uit de bevindingen van dit proefschrift (hoofdstuk 4) blijkt dat aannames van agency-theorie, die vaak in onderzoek naar coöperaties als aanname worden gebruikt, beter kunnen worden behandeld als een empirische kwestie. (3) Dit proefschrift presenteert een ander perspectief op het comparatieve voordeel van de coöperatie in het produceren van voedingsmiddelen met hoogwaardige kwaliteitsattributen. De literatuur over de gevolgen van de coöperatieve structuur voor kwaliteitsmanagement (Merel et al., 2009) benadrukt dat coöperaties de producenten met de hoogste kwaliteit vaak niet adequaat belonen, wat vaak het probleem van averechtse selectie wordt genoemd. Echter, ondanks de grotere heterogeniteit in termen van de capaciteit van producenten om hoge kwaliteit te produceren, kunnen coöperaties producten van hoge kwaliteit bereiken door middel van superieure coördinatie en ondersteuning in de aanpassingen van haar leden. De bevindingen van dit proefschrift zijn in lijn met andere empirische studies buiten het domein van de coöperaties die vonden dat de kwaliteit van de prestaties kunnen worden beïnvloed door relatiekenmerken, en hun effect op de transactiekosten (Lu et al., 2009; Coronado et al., 2010). (4) Samenvattend is de belangrijkste wetenschappelijke bijdrage van dit proefschrift het toepassen van het kader van 'chemie van organisaties’, van Grandori en Furnari (2008), bij het zoeken naar een beter begrip van de governance van coöperaties. Door het gebruiken van genoemd kader behandelt het proefschrift op geïntegreerde wijze de rol van sociaal kapitaal (Ostrom, 1999) en community governance (Bowles en Gintis, 2002; Hayami, 2009) in het stimuleren van collectieve actie, en de rol van relationele contracten (Poppo en Zenger , 2002; Lazzarini, Miller en Zenger, 2004) in het verzekeren van betrokkenheid van partijen in een transactie. Bovendien, met dat kader, behandelt het proefschrift de cognitieve rol van sturingsmechanismen, zoals kennisuitwisseling (Conner en Prahalad, 1996; Grant, 1996) en competentieverhoging (Nooteboom, 2004). De implicaties van dit proefschrift voor het beheer en beleid van coöperaties kunnen worden samengevat in de volgende drie groepen: (1) Het adequaat belonen van boeren en het regelen en bewaken van leverings- en productieprocessen zijn belangrijk voor het verbeteren van betrokkenheid zowel bij collectieve actie als bij een klantgerichte strategie. Het geven van inspraak en het opbouwen van een sociale gemeenschap voor de leden en hun gezinnen zijn belangrijk om meeliftgedrag en het “verkopen-buiten-de-coöperatie-om” te voorkomen. Het wordt aangeraden om ten minste de volgende sturingsmechanismen te combineren: hiërarchische controle, economische prikkels, maatschappelijke betrokkenheid, en democratische inspraak. Tot slot, de communicatie is een belangrijk instrument voor het verbeteren van de betrokkenheid van de leden bij een klantgerichte strategie. (2) Coöperaties kunnen deelnemen aan hoogwaardige ketens en net zo efficiënt en effectief zijn als andere contractuele arrangementen in de agri-food sector. Wat nog belangrijker is, coöperaties kunnen zelfs een voordeel hebben in de productie en marketing van goederen met credence attributen, zoals dierenwelzijn, biologisch en fair trade. Daarom zou beleid gericht op duurzame voedselproductie zich kunnen richten op coöperaties, omdat deze organisatievorm effectiever is in het verlagen van de risico's van meeliftgedrag van boeren. (3) Ledenparticipatie, betrokkenheid, tevredenheid met de leiding en met de strategie van de coöperatie zijn voorbeelden van extra prestatiecriteria naast gerapporteerde winst. Omdat de doelstellingen van de coöperatie verder reiken dan de economische levensvatbaarheid van de collectieve onderneming (Birchall en Ketilson, 2009), moeten de immateriële activa worden meegenomen om de prestatie van de coöperatie te evalueren, en daarmee coöperaties te vergelijken met IOF’s en met andere coöperaties onderling.","","2022-10-06 22:18:23","2022-10-06 22:18:23","2022-10-06 22:18:23","","149","","","","","Governance of the Member-Cooperative Relationship","","","","","Wageningen University and Research","Netherlands","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798516044984","","","","","Behavior; Decision making; Management; Participation; Economics; Agriculture; Questionnaires; Democracy; Food; Attitudes; Social capital; Vegetables; Organization theory; Agronomy; Agricultural commodities; Agricultural cooperatives; Agricultural economics; Business forms; Competitive advantage; Customers; Farmers; Farms; Gross Domestic Product--GDP; Strategic planning; Supermarkets; Suppliers; Turnover; Value chain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dominance, Grooming, and Experimental Testing of the Effects of Food Distribution on the Behavior of Commensal Bonnet Macaque (Macaca radiata) Females","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1564037972/abstract/E2B7F3D8B454D70PQ/1","According to the socioecological model of female sociality, females living in environments with clumped resources should exhibit strong, linear dominance hierarchies and females in the upper part of these hierarchies should receive less aggression, gain better access to food and receive more grooming than their lower ranked counterparts. This dissertation investigates the predictions of this model using females in a group of bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata). It also investigates the effects of three food distributions (0.25 m2, 1 m 2, and 4 m2) on female aggression. This group had a moderately linear dominance hierarchy (0.63 Modified Landau Index). Although aggressive behavior increased during the feeding experiments, the overall strength of the dominance hierarchy was not significantly affected by an increase in food clumping. Higher ranked females did not receive more grooming than lower ranked females. Females engaged in both reciprocal (12.6%) and non-reciprocal bouts (87.4 %) of grooming and reciprocal grooming was time matched. Although most grooming was not immediately reciprocated, females did not appear to be trading grooming for another commodity, except, potentially, for coalitionary support. Grooming was more reciprocal across bouts than within bouts showing increased grooming reciprocity between partners over time. This long-term reciprocity suggests that bonnet macaque females reciprocate grooming over long spans of time effectively increasing the proportion of reciprocal grooming and decreasing the amount traded in a biological market. Females showed different types of competition as the experimental food distribution was decreased. High ranking females consumed more than low ranking females in each distribution. The greatest rank asymmetry in feeding was found in the highly clumped condition due to the ability of dominant individuals to monopolize the feeding platform. However, the number of aggressive acts among females was significantly lower in both clumped distributions than in the dispersed condition. Usurpation, as measured by agonistic acts, was higher in the dispersed condition, but competition through monopolization was greatest in the highly clumped condition as expected by the socioecological model. Competition in the highly clumped condition could not be measured by quantity of agonistic behavior illustrating the importance of distinguishing between monopolizability and usurpability when analyzing levels of competition.","","2022-10-06 22:18:47","2022-10-06 22:18:47","2022-10-06 22:18:47","","131","","","","","Why Do Females Live in Groups?","","","","","University of California, San Diego","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781321084849","","","","","Dominance; Primates; Psychology; Field experiments; Biological sciences; Bonnet macaques; Female competition; Food distribution; Grooming; Macaca radiata","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In relation to language use in education, this study reveals the ways in which middle class residents assign meanings and values to Marathi (the regional language of Maharashtra), Hindi, and English, their use, and how middle-class and largely upper caste urban Indian residents use languages as markers of aspects of their identities to shape understandings of the city and aspirations. The project views social change through the lens of linguistic repertoires in and around education through an analysis of language use in Pune, captured through ethnographic methods such as participant observation and structures/unstructured interviews. Implicit questions that undergird this collection of chapters is to discern the boundaries of languages and the relevance of mother tongues in India today. With a focus on the contemporary urban, middle-class and upper caste Indian linguistic context this is an ethnography through the lens of language use in and about education and educational institutions. The data and analysis address contribute to ongoing debates of the implications, benefits, and compromises made in different language mediums of education in multilingual, postcolonial societies in today’s world and nuances the role of English in processes of language shift. More generally, I address topics from a grass-roots level from parents and students and teachers in their classrooms rather than from a top-down approach through educational policy and administration to present a picture of contemporary mother tongue or regional language use in India.","","2022-10-06 22:18:54","2022-10-06 22:18:54","2022-10-06 22:18:54","","354","","","","","","","","","","The George Washington University","United States -- District of Columbia","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781392118726","","","","","Social sciences; Education; India; Identity; Marathi; Mother tongues","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cette mesure peut être définie selon : le revenu, l’autorité, l’autonomie et les compétences. En ce basant sur des entrevues auprès de délinquants incarcérés (n=138), cette étude évalue si la notion de prestige s’applique aux occupations illicites. Les résultats suggèrent que les domaines d’activité des occupations illicites ne présentent pas d’homogénéité en termes de prestige. Certaines caractéristiques définissant le prestige des occupations licites, comme le revenu et la compétence, contribuent à définir le prestige des occupations illicites, par contre, l’autonomie et l’autorité n’y contribuent pas. Le milieu criminel présente des caractéristiques particulières comme la difficulté d’atteindre une continuité dans son occupation. Cette continuité explique le prestige des occupations illicites, mais non celui des occupations licites. D’autres indicateurs, comme le réseau criminel et la présence d’un mentor, influençant pourtant les revenus, n’ont pas d’impact sur le prestige des occupations illicite. Des modèles d’équations structurelles ont été utilisés pour vérifier les relations indirectes et les conversions entre les types de capitaux selon la théorie de l’espace social de Pierre Bourdieu. Ces analyses suggèrent l’essentialité de la notion de compétence et de continuité.

In this thesis, I develop an organisation-centred perspective based on the three distinct and relatively independent literatures of climate change adaptation, organisation theory and network analysis to study the emerging adaptation initiatives in developing countries. I use the term ‘organising adaptation’, to focus analytical attention on the organisational architectures and linkages that are critical, to develop coordinated responses, and to move forward from policy and plans to practical action. I present my results in four empirical papers from a detailed study of organising climate change adaptation in the agriculture sector in Ghana, supplemented with analysis from Nepal and Pakistan. I adopt a ‘granular’ and ‘nested’ design, backed by extensive empirical field data to analyse the effect and connectedness of key organisations in adaptation from local to national planning levels. The results show that the planned structures take on an organisational form composed of many component organisations (I refer to them as ‘meta-organisation’), but these structures are out of alignment with the requirements needed to address challenges posed by climate change. The component organisations in turn form implicit sub-groups (I refer to them as organisation-communities) and take on specific roles that are asymmetric and the challenges are often articulated in way that conflicts with, or thwarts, other capacity, leading to gaps in potential adaptation action. The findings of the papers emphasise that organisations and their relationships matter greatly but that it is also important to examine how these organisations work and what they do within the wider networks involved in adaptation. </p>","2016","2022-10-06 22:19:41","2022-10-06 22:19:41","2022-10-06 22:19:41","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oxford","","English","","http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","","","ora.ox.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the weeks and months following the disaster, Congress held hearings to discover the cause of the spill. Although this was an ideal opportunity for Congressional participants to discuss systemic issues related to energy production and consumption, most lawmakers focused instead on the alleged alcoholism of the ship's captain, Joseph Hazelwood, and on the inept oil spill recovery efforts of the Exxon Corporation. This study employs Kenneth Burke's theory of guilt redemption through the scapegoating process to explain the effectiveness of rhetorical appeals by participants in Congressional hearings. These arguments worked to set discussion on relatively minor policy issues, perpetuating the belief that alcohol was solely responsible for the accident and that oil companies could effectively recover significant quantities of spilled oil. Contrary to the popular belief that scapegoats are innocent, this work shows how Joseph Hazelwood and the Exxon Corporation fulfilled the characteristics of consubstantiality, division, and re-identification that Burke says are essential for scapegoating to occur.","","2022-10-06 22:19:47","2022-10-06 22:19:47","2022-10-06 22:19:47","","383","","","","","Scapegoats and oil spills","","","","","University of Pittsburgh","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780599078024","","","","","Social sciences; Language; literature and linguistics; Health and environmental sciences; Rhetoric; Alaska; Congressional; Exxon Valdez; Oil spills; Scapegoats","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The empirical work is based on Probit models that were applied on a panel of data covering local leaders of 335 cities between 1999 and 2009. Results Our research confirms that a better record of relative local economic growth significantly boosts the promotion probability of the city-level party secretary. However, the importance of economic work will significantly decrease if the cadres have strong open signals of their competence. Conclusions The findings in this article suggest that there exists a performance-based screening scheme for selecting political elites in China.

Organized and hosted by the Japanese American National Museum (JANM) in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, Boyle Heights delineated what it was like to live in a multiethnic East Los Angeles community during the early and mid twentieth century. The thesis examines why Boyle Heights was so successful in garnering enthusiasm from the Boyle Heights community. I posit that the exhibit's success was largely due to its compelling narrative depicting Boyle Heights as a unique and ethnically diverse community whose residents built a tight -knit neighborhood while embodying the hallmarks of law- abiding, all-American model citizenship. I argue that this depiction of Boyle Heights helped counteract popular stereotypes of East Los Angeles as a vice-ridden and impoverished zone. While Boyle Heights made many positive contributions to its subject community, I also assert that the exhibition had to leave out important stories in its effort to present a certain image of Boyle Heights. Stories left out include episodes of interethnic conflicts, intraethnic tensions, and subjects suggesting non-model, criminal behaviors. Amidst the effort to delineate Boyle Heights as a harmonious and model example of interethnic community, these silences became a necessary device to convincingly bolster the neighborhood's worthiness of being celebrated and remembered in the context of today's society and public perceptions. More importantly, what do these silences reveal about the workings of racial socioeconomic positioning in American society","2010","2022-10-06 22:20:15","2022-10-06 22:20:15","2022-10-06 22:20:15","","","","","","","History in the making","","","","","UC San Diego","","en","","","","","escholarship.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The theory of dialectical tension (Baxter and Montgomery, 1996) situates the conceptual discussion around the struggles between autonomy and subordination within gender roles, personal growth versus technological competency, and issues of economic and resource control in traditional hierarchies. We find that midwives engage in legitimization strategies, develop peer support, and focus on strategic issues to develop the capacity for agency and autonomy, despite socio-organizational barriers.

The hierarchical perspective tends to treat public managers at the top as leaders, public employees at the bottom as followers, and leadership as management. This study proposes shared leadership as an alternative to traditional leadership approaches. In theory, shared leadership is not about a hierarchical position but about a mutually shared process that occurs throughout public organizations. The literature has made assertions that shared leadership emerges from horizontal organizations, adaptable cultures, and turbulent environments. However, little research has been conducted to test the effects of these organizational dimension variables on shared leadership in either the public or private sector. This study is a first step to examine the multiple relationships among organizational structure, culture, and context and shared leadership. It is also a first attempt to measure the concept of shared leadership. This study presents case-based empirical research. The study collects data from public employees across the bottom and the top of Broward County government in Florida because the study asserts that every public employee, regardless of hierarchical position, can be a public leader and display leadership. The data was collected using a mail survey of 261 public employees in the county government. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to test the conceptual model developed in this study. The model consists of five hypothesized positive relationships (hierarchy of position, functional specialization, supportive culture, technology, and organizational crisis), five hypothesized negative relationships (hierarchy of authority, centralization, bureaucratic and innovative cultures, and organizational size), and one positive or negative control variable (gender) with shared leadership. The results show that organizational crisis, technology, innovative culture, and hierarchy of position variables are significantly and positively associated with shared leadership. Public employees' perceptions of shared leadership are partially explainable from organizational structure, culture, and context factors. Indicating that shared leadership occurs in the perceptions of street-level public employees, this study implies that the horizontal and hierarchical perspectives on leadership coexist in bureaucratic organizations. This study concludes that every public employee displays leadership and is a public leader.","","2022-10-06 22:20:44","2022-10-06 22:20:44","2022-10-06 22:20:44","","238","","","","","A conceptual model of the emergence of shared leadership","","","","","Florida Atlantic University","United States -- Florida","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780542750045","","","","","Leadership; Social sciences; Culture; Organizational structure; Shared leadership; Public employee","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A multiple-agent model with a linear compensation rule is used to show that the optimal incentive structure is determined by the degree of relatedness of the two firms (e.g., cash flows correlation). In particular, the model implies a horizontal (or lateral) structure for related (expansion) acquisitions and a vertical structure for unrelated (diversification) combinations. Empirical evidence is presented that is consistent with this implication. The linear compensation rule makes it possible to analytically solve for an optimal compensation schedule and obtain the net payoff to shareholders for each organization. The vertical structure is assumed to enable one manager to perfectly monitor another manager which benefits the shareholders, while two agents are assumed to play a Nash game in choosing their optimal effort in the horizontal organization. Optimal contracts are derived from the perspective of the stockholders of the acquiring firm. Generally, a vertical structure is used due to the benefit of perfect monitoring. However, in horizontal combinations, stockholders benefit from competition between the managements of the two firms, and this is possible through a relative performance contract in a horizontal organization structure. We also show that a synergy effect, in the sense of a positive production externality, makes the relative performance contract less effective and the vertical organization a more dominant organizational structure.","","2022-10-06 22:20:56","2022-10-06 22:20:56","2022-10-06 22:20:56","","87","","","","","Postmerger managerial incentive structure","","","","","University of Michigan","United States -- Michigan","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798206933659","","","","","Social sciences; merger","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through reflecting on the teacher's own experiences in three different contexts of educational change, the teacher provides insight into how issues of agency, group size, collegial relationships, hierarchy and politics impacted the teacher's decision-making and affective domain as a participant and their perceptions of self-efficacy. High levels of agency, small group sizes, trusting pre-existing relationships, lack of hierarchy and low levels of political involvement in the change initiatives all increased the teacher's engagement and self-efficacy in the reforms.

The means to analyze Reagan's discourse is Kenneth Burke's cycle of guilt, victimage, redemption and rebirth. Ten speeches of President Reagan are analyzed: both of his Inaugural Addresses, his Economic Recovery Speech, and his seven State of the Union Addresses. Analysis revealed a consistent pattern of federal bureaucratic attack throughout Reagan's eight years in office. Although Reagan successfully utilized his benign scapegoating, concern arises when the United States' form of government, representative democracy, is considered. Scapegoating can stifle discourse, a potentially dangerous outcome for a free and open society.","","2022-10-06 22:52:37","2022-10-06 22:52:37","2022-10-06 22:52:37","","173","","","","","The rhetoric of the benign scapegoat","","","","","Louisiana State University and Agricultural & Mechanical College","United States -- Louisiana","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493069845","","","","","Social sciences; Language; literature and linguistics; Rhetoric; Scapegoat; Federal government; Reagan; Ronald; Ronald Reagan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous investigations have focused primarily on collaborative inquiry as an interpretive research method; this literature does not clarify how adult learning is facilitated by collaborative inquiry. This dissertation investigates the question, ""How is learning experienced in collaborative inquiry groups?"" In this study, collaborative inquiry is defined as, ""a process of repeated episodes of reflection and action through which a group of peers strives to answer a compelling question, a question of importance for each person in that group."" Additionally, ten criteria for engaging in collaborative inquiry are delineated. Five doctoral students at Teachers College, Columbia University, one of whom is the author of this dissertation, formed a collaborative inquiry group to gain understanding about learning in such groups. Each student initiated a field inquiry group, thereby creating a unique research design--one in which central collaborative inquiry group members interacted with one another and the five field inquiry groups. My field inquiry group consisted of public school teachers seeking to improve their teaching practice. A critical review of the literature clarifies the dissimilarities between phenomenological and pragmatic approaches to research, learning and experience. Each methodology posits a different relationship between learning and experience. Our research sought a holistic understanding of learning, one attained through a phenomenological perspective. Descriptive and hermeneutic phenomenological perspectives of the learning experience of both the central and my field group are included. Poetry is utilized to convey holistically our understanding of learning. There are too many themes to specify each here, however a brief excerpt of poetry illustrates the dynamic way in which participants are changed during their inquiries. $\rm \vskip5pt\sk{70} Loosened\ from\ the\ wheel,\cr\vskip.1pt\sk{72} I\ carry\ it\ within.\cr\vskip.1pt\sk{70} We\ made\ a\ journey,\cr\vskip.1pt\sk{70} we\ did\ not\ foreshow.\cr\vskip.1pt\sk{70} We\ reached\ horizons,\cr\vskip.1pt\sk{70} we\ did\ not\ foresee.\cr\vskip.1pt\sk{70} I\ long\ for\ the\ wheel.\cr\vskip.1pt\sk{70} I\ could\ not\ have\ foreknown.\cr\vskip.2pt$ Six eidetic themes for the six collaborative inquiry groups present our common interpretive themes.

While researchers have begun to explore the experience of deployment on Service member spouses, little research has focused specifically on their service seeking behavior regarding accessing mental health services. This is unfortunate given that multiple studies have indicated the importance of including Service member's spouses in future research. This qualitative study included both Service members and spouses of Service member's in an attempt to capture their mental health counseling service seeking behaviors. Thematic analysis was employed to develop a model of mental health seeking behavior among Service members and their spouses. The resulting model is unique in that it attempts to account for the influence of multiple contextual and ecological factors.

Forty-five racially and socioeconomically diverse children between the ages of 6–10, and fifty-nine of their parents, were both interviewed individually and observed as they interacted with each other. Parents were administered the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM), a newly constructed Socialization Questionnaire, and the Ideas about Parenting scale to assess their racial identity, racial socialization beliefs and practices, and general socialization beliefs and practices, respectively. Racial socialization and children's understanding of prejudice were also inferred from coding of the parent-child interaction, during which the family viewed and discussed a film clip depicting racial prejudice. To assess prejudice and cross-race friendships, the children were administered the Multi-response Racial Attitude Measure (MRA) and asked about their peer networks. In terms of findings, higher levels of parental racial identity were linked to parental socialization beliefs, the child's demonstrated understanding of prejudice (coded from the parent-child interaction), and his or her expressed tolerance on the MRA (child's positive attitudes toward African Americans). Parental racial identity was specifically related to the stated racial socialization beliefs of promotion of mistrust and pluralistic/cultural socialization, but importantly, it was not related to the observed and reported practices of racial socialization. None of the racial socialization factors or observed/reported behaviors were significantly related to child prejudice/tolerance. In fact, general socialization beliefs were more predictive of child racial attitudes than was parental racial socialization, with authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive beliefs related to distinct child prejudice measures. Race of the parent was found to moderate some of the relationships between these variables. Specifically, for parents of color (compared to white parents), racial identity was more clearly associated with racial socialization practices and child tolerance. For white parents, however, general socialization techniques were the stronger correlates of their children's racial tolerance. However, as predicted, colorblind socialization in white families was related to fewer cross-race peers of their children. Children's demonstrated understanding of prejudice/discrimination (as coded from the parent-child interaction) was linked to their tolerant attitudes toward blacks. Although neither racial nor general socialization on the part of parents were predictive of this variable of the child's understanding of discrimination/prejudice, parent's racial identity and level of comfort discussing race, discrimination, and prejudice were linked to this important variable. Overall, the familial correlates of children's racial prejudice and tolerance are complex. Future directions, implications, and limitations of this work are discussed.","","2022-10-06 22:53:11","2022-10-06 22:53:11","2022-10-06 22:53:11","","68","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Berkeley","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780496056989","","","","","Social sciences; Psychology; Prejudice; Socialization; Children; Parental; Racial identity; Tolerance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study combined information about gender stereotypes regarding leadership ability and gender stereotypes regarding math and reasoning ability in attempt to explain the lack of female participation and leadership in the STEM fields. An implicit association test (IAT) was administered to measure implicit gender stereotypes about leadership, and IAT scores had the expected positive relationships with neosexism and modern sexism. There were significant gender differences in IAT scores, neosexism, modern sexism, and concern about discrimination. However, all groups of participants indicated stereotypical associations pairing men with leadership traits and women with follower or supporter traits. STEM status made no difference in participants’ subscription to implicit gender leadership stereotypes. Implications of negative leadership stereotypes for women in the workplace are discussed, along with limitations, suggestions about how to attenuate the effects of gender stereotypes in the workplace, and directions for future research.","","2022-10-06 22:53:48","2022-10-06 22:53:48","2022-10-06 22:53:48","","66","","","","","Implicit Stereotypes","","","","","Clemson University","United States -- South Carolina","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.S.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781392219539","","","","","Leadership; Social sciences; Psychology; Gender; Women; Implicit bias; Iat; STEM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To be sure, there are political scientists who have made important contributions to the study of indigenous politics. However, the bulk of the discipline either does not place indigenous politics in its field of vision or it analyzes it through frameworks that forestall adequate analysis. The worst offender in this regard is American political science, both in the sense of the sub-field that studies the United States and the scholarship and institutions (i.e. political science departments, associations, journals) of the country. A good deal of my discussion will thus focus on American political science. But my focus will not be exclusively on the U.S. context, as I see the invisibility and distortion of indigenous politics to be a problem one can locate in other liberal-democracies built upon a foundation of settler-colonialism and across the sub-fields of political science. While there are a number of viable routes one can take to address this matter, I focus on two active and increasingly prevalent topics of study in political science scholarship; that is, first, work on sovereignty and the state and, second, work on race and ethnicity politics. As it concerns both areas, I reveal the predispositions within that shield or distract scholars from seeing the value and importance of indigenous politics. These predispositions are: i) the emphasis on sovereignty as an exclusive characteristic of the state; ii) the inability of much of the scholarship on the politics of race and ethnicity to account for or understand the political identity and politics of indigenous people. In my discussions of both areas and predispositions, there will be consistent reference to the role of settler-colonialism as a historical and persistent structuring force in political life. As such, my analysis of these topic areas and their predispositions is, among other things, an effort to refuse the general inattention to settler-colonialism in much of the political science discipline. In short, I claim that taking indigenous politics seriously means taking settler-colonialism seriously, and vice versa.","2012-05-17","2022-10-06 22:56:47","2022-10-06 22:56:47","2022-10-06 22:56:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","Indigenous Politics; Political Science; Race and Ethnicity Politics; Settler Colonialism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2061662","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Attempts to initiate or sustain hierarchies are often met with resistance; hierarchs then adopt new strategies, which in turn prompt new strategies of resistance; and so on. The key point is that the struggle is typically conducted using moral concepts in justifications for or against unequal power and involves the stimulation of the moral emotions. Both parties to the struggle treat morality as a valuable strategic resource; and the dynamic of interaction between hierarchs and resisters generates changes in that resource. The hierarch/resister struggle is in part a competition between moral concepts and justifications, and that competition drives the emergence of new moral concepts and justifications, just as competition in other contexts generates innovations. Among the moral concepts generated by the struggle are the following: authority, legitimacy, aristocracy, the divine right of kings, the mandate of heaven, natural rights, civil and political rights, constitutionalism, the rule of law, sovereignty, collective self-determination, exploitation, oppression, and domination.","2021","2022-10-06 22:57:45","2022-10-06 22:57:45","2022-10-06 22:57:45","232-260","","2","38","","","THE PERPETUAL STRUGGLE","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","evolution of moral concepts; hierarchs; resisters; strategic weapons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In housing development processes, governance structures—markets, hierarchies and network or relational structures—change as the process proceeds, and so do the goals that are set by all stakeholders, including local authorities. A framework for evaluation is set out that takes account of this temporal component. It is applied empirically to three case studies in the city of Arnhem (The Netherlands). The paper concludes that the effectiveness of steering housing production by local authorities depends on choosing appropriate governance structures, setting realistic goals, and a local authority that acts accordingly. Many of the choices with regard to goals and governance structures are not made autonomously but are structured by the spatial and institutional context in which they operate. A systematic evaluation of the performance of governance structures, within their context, could improve local government’s capacity to steer housing production.","2009-06-01","2022-10-06 22:57:53","2022-10-06 22:57:53","2022-10-06 22:57:53","185-201","","2","24","","J Hous and the Built Environ","Steering local housing production","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Governance structures; Housing development; Land policy; Location development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through an engagement with the debates on the politics of scale, the argument is made that a new spatial grammar of environmental governance must be sensitive to both the politics of scale and the politics of networks. Rather than considering scalar and non-scalar interpretations of spatiality as necessarily opposite, the paper argues that through a more careful deployment of concepts of hierarchy and territory common ground between scalar and network geographies can be forged, and can inform our understanding of environmental governance. In making this argument, the paper provides an overview of contemporary configurations of global environmental governance, and seeks to illustrate by reference to one transnational municipal network, the Cities for Climate Protection programme, how governing the environment involves both political processes of scaling and rescaling the objects and agents of governance, as well as attempts to create new, networked, arenas of governance.

The study utilized previously videotaped interactions of seventy-six maritally intact community families with a biological child between the ages of 4 and 7 years who were randomly assigned to a 10-minute interaction where parents either conjointly played with their child or supervised their child in a clean-up task. The SGFO encompassed global ratings of 4 constructs evident during family interactions, including: child misbehavior, co-parenting, family cohesion, and disengagement. Raters used a 9-point scale to rate each construct after watching the entire 10-minute interaction. Inter-rater reliability for the ratings was assessed and demonstrated acceptable levels (intraclass correlation coefficient > .69). In addition, validity of the SGFO was assessed. First, the SGFO demonstrated more positive behaviors in the play condition and more negative behaviors in the clean-up condition. Second, positive family behaviors were related to other positive family behaviors and negative family behaviors were related to other negative family behaviors. Third, mother's self-report of increased child externalizing behavior problems was related to increased observed child misbehavior in the clean-up condition. Fourth, father's self-report of increased marital satisfaction was associated with lower levels of observed child misbehavior. None of the expected associations were found between parents' reports of their parenting and observed behavior using the SGFO. Throughout, the results (reliability and validity) for the SGFO were compared to results found with the same sample using a previously employed microanalytic coding system used in the larger project from which the data for this study were drawn. While the microanalytic coding system produced more overall correlations, the SGFO demonstrated more of the expected and less of the unexpected relationships. In addition, the SGFO was more cost-effective than the microanalytic coding system. The implications of these findings and the unexpected findings with the microanalytic coding system are discussed. Ways in which the findings support family system's theory are presented.","","2022-10-06 22:58:05","2022-10-06 22:58:05","2022-10-06 22:58:05","","164","","","","","Development of the System for Global Family Observations (SGFO)","","","","","Bowling Green State University","United States -- Ohio","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780496271429","","","","","Psychology; Family interaction; Forced compliance tasks; Play; System for Global Family Observations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scholars have called this heteronomy, arguing that it preceded and may follow the modern sovereign state system and that it has characterized various historical locales around the world. We maintain that this conception has been under-examined, and we identity three different forms of heteronomy that existed historically. These include: (1) interstitial heteronomy, where polities with limited capacity in low-density regions experience zones of informal mixed rule on the frontier; (2) functional heteronomy, where states in thickly populated systems develop complex patterns of functional differentiation; and (3) personalistic heteronomy, where power that is invested in individuals rather than territorially defined polities can produce patterns of dual vassalage. We develop a theory of heteronomy based on the density of the system (low, high) and the nature of political relations (territorial, personal), and using the resulting two-dimensional map we explore the form of heteronomy that existed and may exist in different systems across time and space. We conclude that when scholars envisage heteronomy in the modern system, it is mostly functional, and not interstitial or personalistic heteronomy, which they have in mind.","2022-03-01","2022-10-06 22:58:40","2022-10-06 22:58:40","2022-10-06 22:58:40","sqac004","","1","66","","International Studies Quarterly","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study of reciprocal peer supervision asked: (a) Do trainees in counseling psychology tend to make different uses of faculty and peer supervision? (b) Do content analysis patterns in peer and faculty supervision change over time? and (c) Could differences in trainee uses of faculty and peer supervision be accounted for by trainee expectations or perceptions of supervisory behaviors, of the empathy, regard, unconditionality and congruence in supervisors, or of supervisory competence? Six doctoral students in a clinical practicum were audiotaped during individual sessions with both faculty and peer supervisors three times during a semester. The faculty supervisor was the clinic director; the peer supervisor was another student with whom roles of supervisor and supervisee were regularly exchanged. Two raters made a content analysis of sessions, classifying each ten seconds of supervisee talk into one of 30 categories, which were grouped for analysis into eight general categories. Results indicated that supervisees, considered individually, tended to focus on the same topics with peer supervisors as with the faculty supervisor, in about the same proportions. ""Client Focus"" and ""Self Focus"" were the most-used categories, accounting for over half of the supervisee talk in almost every session rated. For all supervisees, more time was spent on ""Client Focus"" and on ""Client-Self Interactional Focus"" in peer than in faculty sessions. Two methods of subscaling Supervisor Behavior Scales were employed to yield scores on teaching, evaluation and support dimensions. As predicted, supervisees expected the faculty supervisor to provide more teaching and evaluation, the peer supervisor to provide more support. They perceived faculty and peer supervisors to have offered about the same teaching and evaluation as they had expected, and peer supervisors to have offered more support. Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory scores were in the positive range for both faculty and peer supervisors, with peers scoring higher on all four dimensions. Evaluations of supervisory competence were higher for the faculty supervisor at the beginning and end of the semester. Indications from this study are that reciprocal peer supervision is a useful technique of training which is in some ways complementary to faculty supervision and which merits further research.","","2022-10-06 22:59:23","2022-10-06 22:59:23","2022-10-06 22:59:23","","228","","","","","","","","","","Temple University","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798204943216","","","","","Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While it is expected that residents will provide feedback to peers, there has been no social network study of the hierarchy through which feedback flows. Methods Data for this study was drawn from clinical records of peer corrections exchanged between TC residents in six units kept over periods of less than two to over eight years. Four of the units served men while two served women. Hierarchy position was measured using eigenvector centrality, on the assumption that residents who were more central in the network of corrections were lower in the hierarchy. It was hypothesized that residents would rise in the hierarchy over time. This was tested using Wilcoxon paired samples tests comparing the mean and maximum eigenvector centrality for time in treatment with those in the last month of treatment. It was also hypothesized that residents who rose higher in the hierarchy were more likely to graduate, the outcome of primary interest. Logistic regression was used to test hierarchy position as a predictor of graduation, controlling for age, race, risk of recidivism as measured by the Level of Services Inventory-Revised (LSI-R) and days spent in the program. Results Residents averaged a statistically significantly lower eigenvector centrality in the last month in all units, indicating a rise in the hierarchy over time. Residents with lower maximum and average eigenvector centrality both over the length of treatment and in the last month of treatment were more likely to graduate in four of the six units, those with lower maximum and average eigenvector centrality in the last month but not over the length of treatment were more likely to graduate in one of the six units, while eigenvector centrality did not predict graduation in one unit. However, this last unit was much smaller than the others, which may have influenced the results. Conclusion These results suggest that TC residents move through a social network hierarchy and that movement through the hierarchy predicts successful graduation.","2021-12-16","2022-10-06 22:59:36","2022-10-06 22:59:36","2022-10-06 22:59:36","e0261405","","12","16","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Centrality; Eigenvectors; Social networks; Birds; Medical risk factors; Graduates; Health care facilities; Substance abuse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, the exodus from wage labor on one side, and the embrace of meaningful, freely chosen and “free” (unpaid) work on the other. A product of three decades of decomposition of the working class, nowtopians are different from “drop-outs” in general, or surplus populations that constitute the necessary “outside” to capital, in their conscious withdrawal from capitalist culture and concerted rejection of the value form. In emergent convivial “nowtopian” communities, largely grounded in unpaid practical work which creatively meets needs such as transportation (the bicycling subculture), food (urban gardening/agriculture), and communication (open-source communities), we see a gradual reversal of the extreme atomization of modern life. While facing the threat of corruption via re-integration into the system, this constellation of practices, if taken together, is an elaborate, decentralized, uncoordinated collective research and development effort exploring a potentially post-capitalist, post-petroleum future.","2010","2022-10-06 23:00:25","2022-10-06 23:00:25","2022-10-06 23:00:25","924-953","","4","42","","","Nowtopia","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2010.00782.x","","","","","collectivity; work; capital; atomization; decomposition of the working class; use value; wage labor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This dissertation provides a close reading of a different approach to leadership, one arising from the cultural community around the Diana's Grove retreat center. This philosophy holds cultural norms of the Cornerstones of Community (choice, thinking well of the group, thinking well of one's self, stewardship of self, and sacred wound) as overt rules that are the foundation of sustainable community interactions. It discusses how service to the idea of community is the primary motivating factor behind this form of leadership, and how that is manifested in the hierarchy of commitment and the work of leading others to their own discovery. It claims that leadership is a shared, communal responsibility, and that one cannot avoid having a leadership impact, even through non-action; because of this, awareness of impact and situational awareness are key leadership skills. The emphasis on service and community lead these practitioners to frequently refer to this as ""priestessing"" rather than leadership, though both terms are used and understood to be roughly comparable. These findings are not culturally-limited; that is, practitioners describe using these leadership practices in a wide variety of cultural situations, both at Diana's Grove and in other cultural contexts. This implies that this is a leadership attitude that is applied constructively regardless of whether or not one is in a recognized leadership role. While that is true, practitioners also describe that it is most useful and most powerful when it is a shared cultural context, with leadership responsibilities shared among the full group. This data was collected through a combination of three methods: interviews with graduates of and teachers in the Diana's Grove priestess path, examination of cultural artifacts and texts, and participant observation in the community.

This paper identifies a different mechanism that could have pernicious social and political consequences. Economic mobility sorts people based on certain ‘productive’ traits, separating them into classes, and thus alters social externalities. This sorting–separation–externalities mechanism can produce between-class polarization in social outcomes (e.g. alcoholism and drug abuse) and worsen aggregate outcomes over all classes, consistent with rising ‘deaths of despair’ in the United States (Case and Deaton, 2020, Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism. Princeton University Press). When traits are endogenous, transition out of a caste-based society produces an initial burst of economic mobility which dissipates over time. Thus, a dynamic meritocratic society devolves into a static class-based society. I set out an alternative model called the ‘experimental society’, which is less susceptible to these problems.","2022-06","2022-10-06 23:00:55","2022-10-06 23:00:55","2022-10-06 23:00:55","501-519","","3","18","","","Markets and communities","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","cultural evolution; social mobility; meritocracy; Z13; Austrian economics; P00; social economics; time preferences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The RIS has played an central role in the development of Taylor's Power law which states that for a given species sampled under similar circumstances, sample variance will be a power function of the mean. Using 13 years data from the RIS to produce TPL parameters, Taylor & Woiwod (1982) predicted that the addition of a second decade of data would not change the parameter estimates. This prediction was tested and a small but significant number (8.7%) of species were found to change parameter values. It is unlikely that this disproves Taylor's Power Law and is probably indicative of environmental change. The range of means used to estimate the TPL parameters was discovered to be of crucial importance and should be greater than 0.4. Traditional measures of spatial pattern used in ecology use only the mean and variance of samples, ignoring the spatial relationship of the counts. SADIE (Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs) is a novel method of spatial analysis which uses all available spatial information within the data to produce two indices, Ia and Ja. Before applying SADIE to the RIS data, the performance of SADIE given a variable sampling density was examined. Ia was found to systematically underestimate spatial pattern under variable sampling density. Ja was less affected by sample density although it is incapable of detecting pattern when more than one cluster is present. A new SADIE-like methodology was devised called Multiple Foci SADIE (MF-SADIE) which extends the Ja concept to data sets with multiple clustering and produces a new index Fa. MF-SADIE was then applied to 23 species of moth from the RIS to look for temporal pattern in their spatial distribution. A range of spatio-temporal patterns was found, from cyclical to almost uniform with good correlation between species sharing food plant types.","","2022-10-06 23:01:24","2022-10-06 23:01:24","2022-10-06 23:01:24","","221","","","","","","","","","","University of Leicester (United Kingdom)","England","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781073261390","","","","","Biological sciences; (UMI)AAIU117881; Moths","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data collection for this analysis was obtained through interviewing with a structured questionnaire. However, the quality of the collected data proved to be rather limited. Hence the results of the analysis should be seen as rather indicative how data envelopment analysis could be used to evaluate the performance of hospitals, than to drive conclusion on the performance of the respective hospital or organizational model. By applying data envelopment analysis, we were able to identify best practice hospitals within the analyzed group and to identify the dimensions underperforming hospitals may improve. A second intention was to analyze if one of the two organization models applied in the public hospitals in Bahia, the traditional public or outsourcing organization model differ in terms of efficiency. In concept, data envelopment may be helpful to identify such differences regarding performance, nevertheless, the analysis of the analyzed group of hospitals returned mixed results.","2006","2022-10-06 23:01:35","2022-10-06 23:01:46","2022-10-06 23:01:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","repositorio.ufba.br","","Accepted: 2013-03-14T18:34:23Z Publisher: Universidade Federal da Bahia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This dissertation uses rhetoric as a normative term serving simultaneously as both the central story line and storyteller. Rhetoric is both the object of study and the lens through which to study. A field study was conducted with the Roanoke County administration. The rhetorical patterns of administrative leaders were observed and documented in their day-to-day activities. Rhetoric is the conceptual glue both highlighting and pulling together different layers of understanding. At the level of theory development and application, this includes building conceptual linkages between leading and organizing. In practice, public administrators know that leading and organizing occur as an integrated whole. Methodologically, a new technique to study the rhetoric of leading and organizing is introduced within the Roanoke County field study. At a normative level, the linkages discovered in the rhetorical discourse of leading and organizing reveal a greater understanding of democratic governance. The field study provides insights into leading and organizing that are also constitutive of a normative position regarding democratic governance.","","2022-10-06 23:01:56","2022-10-06 23:01:56","2022-10-06 23:01:56","","333","","","","","Rhetoric as praxis in leading and organizing a public administration","","","","","Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University","United States -- Virginia","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780599380639","","","","","Social sciences; Language; literature and linguistics; Rhetoric; Democratic governance; Praxis; Public administration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first mission of this project is to clarify how the NSLP functions on a day-to-day basis in Columbus, Ohio. Columbus is used as a sample city, yet the aim of this research is to be transferable to other locations. The second objective is to gain a clearer understanding of the NSLP from the perspective of those who work in the field, and how they would like to improve the Program. This study employs qualitative inquiry through the use of individual interviews and observations to measure the participants. The approach is naturalistic, which encourages the researcher to interact with the sample in their natural environment. The perspective is that of eleven individuals working for the National School Lunch Program. Through a guided interviewing process these participants spoke of their experiences in the current nutritional model, and gave suggestions of improvement. Their stories on nutrition, hopes of better food, and equitable lunches were audio-recorded, and the data were analyzed and coded in a final report. The results from this investigation reveal that the National School Lunch Program is a spike, or a foreign object inserted into an environment, having little interaction with the community. In addition, those working in the National School Lunch Program often did not see problems with the initiative (even in the face of growing obesity, inattentive disorders, and mood issues). During the interviews it became apparent that many in the NSLP see the benefits of bringing in more local, fresher foods for the students, but they could not imagine going against the hierarchy of the NSLP. In response to the first research question, how the NSLP functions, the most frequent response was through near total control. Indeed, this faltering program, one that the USDA has hopes of making healthier, sees itself as unchangeable.","","2022-10-06 23:02:44","2022-10-06 23:02:44","2022-10-06 23:02:44","","172","","","","","","","","","","The Ohio State University","United States -- Ohio","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781109280258","","","","","Education; Health and environmental sciences; Foods of minimal nutritional value; National School Lunch Program; School lunch; School nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It explores the potential contribution coalitions make, through the collaborative activities of their members, to the broader intervention systems in which they are embedded. Using social network analysis, it examines patterns of structural change in a network of 99 organizations focused on youth violence prevention (YVP) over a 5-year period in which 30 of the 99 organizations were involved in a local YVP Coalition. Both longitudinal modeling and cross sectional analyses are used to examine change in system capacity—strong interorganizational networks—related to patterns of network density, centralization, and hierarchy. Somewhat surprisingly, the study found that capacity in the broader YVP Intervention System actually diminished during the 5-year period of the coalition’s operation, though part of the system—the sub-network that made up the YVP Coalition—was marginally strengthened. In this case, therefore, the evidence suggests that power and relational resources in the broader YVP Intervention System were redistributed. The article explores how the definition of capacity related to density and hierarchy may be contextually dependent. Implications for the role of coalitions in building system capacity are discussed.","2015-06-01","2022-10-06 23:03:30","2022-10-06 23:03:30","2022-10-06 23:03:30","381-395","","3","55","","Am J Community Psychol","Reframing Coalitions as Systems Interventions","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Social network analysis; Coalitions; Capacity building; Community change; Systems intervention; Youth violence prevention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It examines the unique context of the Catholic university, identifies elements that influence the leadership of vice-chancellors in this environment and offers an illustration of the distinct context of Catholic higher education in East Africa. The findings have indicated that both the vice-chancellors' personal characteristics and the context in which leadership took place influenced the vice-chancellors' transformational leadership behavior. The environmental characteristics that were identified are: the institutions' affiliation to the Catholic Church, tribal-ethnic tensions, financial stringency, infancy of the institutions, and cultural underpinnings of respect and deference to elders. The study has validated past research that suggests that context is salient in the study of transformational leadership. Moreover, it has confirmed and further described the importance of trust in the relationship between transformational leaders and their followers. Findings have also shown the importance of cultural considerations in defining transformational leadership. Catholic higher education in an African context provides a unique and new environment in which to study leadership behavior. There is a dearth of empirical research that focuses on the behavior of vice-chancellors in leading Catholic institutions of higher education in Africa. This study uses transformational leadership theory as its theoretical lens and is meant to be a springboard for further investigation in the area. A qualitative multiple case study of two past vice-chancellors of two small Catholic universities in East Africa was conducted by applying two strategies of data collection: in-depth interviews and document analysis. A total of 42 individuals was extensively interviewed at both sites. They included: the two former vice-chancellors (as case subjects), and a sampling of those who worked under them as deputy vice-chancellors, deans, department heads, other members of the staff who worked closely with the past vice-chancellors for at least two years, and selected members of the University Councils.

They constructed their right to sell fuel, and their understanding of profit, around the idea of the remainder, rather than around concepts of income, price, or even usefulness. Here, I analyze the remainder as a widely recognized concept of valuation. Drawing on accounts of the practice of gleaning (an ancient ethic of redistribution organized around harvest leftovers) and examining in detail the calculative practices and metaphors used both by drivers and fuel dealers, I demonstrate the centrality of the remainder to popular economies in East Africa today. Roadside exchanges, I argue, reveal established practices of distribution and entitlement that both practically and conceptually challenge liberal common sense around smooth flow, equal exchange, and price-based markets. Muhtasari Nakala hii inaangazia salio au baki kama moja ya dhana msingi katika uchumi za pembeni mwa soko huria. Hususan inaangazia soko la mafuta ya kufyonzwa. Uchumi huu unatekelezwa kando ya barabara kuu za Afrika ya Mashariki. Unahusisha madereva wa lori za masafa marefu kuuza mafuta ‚yaliyobakia‘ kwa wafanyabiashara ambao nao huyachuuza mapembezoni. Madereva na wafanyabiashara hawa hukana uharamu wa kazi hii na kuitambua kama biashara halali ya mabaki. Wahusika hawa hueleza haki yao ya kuuza mafuta haya kwa kupitia dhana ya salio. Hawatumii dhana maarufu kama mapato, bei au hata manufaa. Hapa, ninachambua salio kama mbinu mbadala ya kufumbua swala la thamani. Ninaandika nikifuatilia masimulizi ya kitendo cha kubuga (utaratibu wa kale wa usambazaji mali uliohimiza matajiri kubakisha masazo baada ya mavuno kwa manufaa ya wasiojiweza). Ninanuia kukagua kwa undani istiari za kibiashara pamoja na taratibu za kukokotoa zinazotumiwa na wanaoendeleza biashara hii. Kwa njia hii, ninakusudia kufafanua umuhimu wa salio katika shughuli za uchumi usio rasmi. Napendekeza kuwa biashara ya kando ya barabara hubainisha desturi mbadala za usambazaji wa mali pamoja na mbinu bunifu za kuwasilisha madai ya kimali. Kama dhana na pia kwa matumizi ya kila siku, desturi hizi zinakaidi matarajio ya itikadi ya soko huria, kwa mfano mtiririko huru wa utajiri, mabadilishano sawia, na masoko yanayozingatia bei kwa utambuzi wa thamani.","2020-08-03","2022-10-06 23:04:00","2022-10-06 23:04:00","2022-10-06 23:04:00","462-486","","3","35","","","The Right to the Remainder","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2020 American Anthropological Association","","","","journal.culanth.org","","Number: 3","","","","","biashara (haramu/halali)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"GT9FCWVC","thesis","2019","Block, Emily May","How the Clinical Environment Shapes the Relationship Between Medical Learners and Clinical Teachers","","","","","https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/handle/11375/25292","Introduction: A trusting relationship between medical learners and clinical teachers is vital for educational and clinical productivity. Perceptions of a trusting relationship are influenced by the learner’s perception of the interpersonal risk (i.e. being humiliated) for engaging in learning behaviours (e.g. asking questions, seeking feedback, learning from mistakes). Perceptions of low interpersonal risk are linked to learners feeling comfortable engaging in learning behaviours. What is less clear is how the clinical environment may influence a medical learner’s perception of trust.  Methods: Using constructivist grounded theory, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 medical clerks and 10 clinical educators affiliated with a single institution. Interviews explored participants’ personal experiences of positive, negative or challenging learner-teacher relationships in the clinical environment.  Results: Through qualitative analysis, we developed a theory of Co-Navigation which describes how teachers and learners have common points of interaction to solidify or diminish trust as they navigate the dynamics of the clinical environment. These points in the relationship that each must co-navigate include: preparing to work together; asking questions; engaging in clinical work; and addressing learner mistakes. Perceptions of whether the opportunity solidified or dissolved trust, arose from learners’ perception of the amount of effort their teacher made to mitigate stress learners experienced in the learning environment.   Limitations: Our interview participants were recruited as individuals; we did not examine their perceptions of their relationships with each other. Co-recruitment of teacher-learner dyads may be a strategy to further refine this theory in future research.  Conclusion: The Co-Navigation theory helps teachers and learners identify key opportunities in the relationship and suggests approaches to solidifying trust at these critical junctures. It highlights the role the clinical environment plays in facilitating and constraining opportunities to establish trust.","2019","2022-10-06 23:04:07","2022-10-06 23:04:07","2022-10-06 23:04:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","Thesis","","","macsphere.mcmaster.ca","","Accepted: 2020-02-14T19:59:11Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neoliberal and New Public Management agendas have influenced widespread insecurity, and limited career progression pathways within academic work. Qualitative multi-case data inform this investigation of how young academic workers cope with, and justify, their precarious situations in a large Australian university. This article introduces the notion of cruel optimism to analyse the unethical exploitation of desires of precariously employed academics. This analytical engagement extends empathetic engagement with the lived experiences and rationalisations of precariously employed academic workers, paying homage to their desires and negotiations. Findings demonstrate that participants were heavily invested in working towards achieving their good life fantasy which encompassed secure employment and the recognition this provided. Cruel optimism operated as participants developed coping mechanisms to deal with the ongoingness of their troubling situation as precarious workers uncertain how to change their precarious circumstances. Participants experienced cruel optimism as they navigated through issues of identity, control, and desire, related to their present and future lives as academic workers experiencing an impasse of crisis ordinariness. Optimism directed towards the academic scene of desire motivated participants’ daily actions and informed their understandings. Ethical elements of the impasse of precarious employment are presented in relation to the neoliberal and New Public Management-oriented University context.

The existing literature on relations of dominance amongst the Akan has flaws: works examine single relations of dominance in isolation; studies focus mostly on discontinuity and change; peripheral areas are neglected. In the dissertation these issues are addressed. Hierarchy is used as an analytical tool which enables one to link diverse expressions of dominance; the persistence of certain hierarchical patterns throughout the twentieth century is analysed alongside transformations; and the focus is on Sefwi, a marginal region of the Akan world.</p> <p>The dissertation is divided into five sections. The introduction presents the methodological and theoretical approach adopted in the work. Part one is concerned with change in hierarchical patterns: twentieth-century dynamics are analysed to determine the extent of change with reference to chiefly power, capitalist.relations and gender issues. Part two shows that unequal relations inform three hierarchical domains -ancestry, gender and seniority. Part three addresses the issue of the coherence and unity of hierarchy by examining modes of organization of experience that cut across the three domains of inequality: reference is made to the use of kinship terms; concepts of ownership, caretakership and help; recourse to the supernatural; food and drink transactions. In the conclusion, Sefwi hierarchy is examined in a wider comparative and theoretical perspective with reference to the notions of 'encompassing of the contrary' (Dumont) and 'fetishization' (Marx).</p>","1999","2022-10-06 23:06:09","2022-10-06 23:06:09","2022-10-06 23:06:09","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oxford","","English","","http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","","","ora.ox.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While there seems to be an increasing demand, the  promise of governance to compensate for the weakness or failure of government  rests on a major premise. Governments have to be strong enough so that non-  governmental actors have an incentive to cooperate, and governments are not  afraid of being captured. If this premise held, it would result in a serious  dilemma for areas of limited statehood: The greater the demand for governance  with/out government, the less likely it is to emerge and to be effective,  precisely because government is weak. This paper explores to what extent  government and statehood are necessary to make governance with/out government  work. It discusses various options of how to commit non-governmental actors to  the provision of common goods without a shadow of hierarchy cast by government  and concludes with suggestions for future research on governance beyond  statehood.","2010","2022-10-06 23:08:46","2022-10-06 23:08:46","2022-10-06 23:08:46","","","","","","","Governance with/out Government","","","","","","","eng","http://www.fu-berlin.de/sites/refubium/rechtliches/Nutzungsbedingungen","","","","refubium.fu-berlin.de","","Accepted: 2018-06-08T07:26:58Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multilevel analyses of several indicators of nutrition and healthcare of children below the age of three years are used to investigate the extent of gender discrimination and the impact of class, female status, religion, and context on gender bias. The analysis of educational discrimination is restricted to children between the ages of seven and eighteen, and follows a similar analytic method. The data are taken from the second Indian National Family Health Survey conducted in 1998–99. The analysis of nutrition shows the existence of discrimination when the outcome is based on anthropometric data, rather than on mother's recall. Young girls have a lower, standardized weight-for-age than young boys, and are significantly more likely to suffer from malnutrition. Social class, and individual level female status variables moderate gender discrimination in incidence of malnutrition. Further, context influences gender discrimination. Communities with higher female status exhibit lower gender differentials in weight-for-age and incidence of malnutrition. Context also moderates the effect of the individual level moderators on gender discrimination. The analysis of healthcare shows the existence of discrimination against female children with regard to healthcare practices. There is evidence of a gender bias against females in immunization coverage and medical treatment for fever or respiratory ailments. There is hardly any evidence of moderating effects of class, female status, or religion on gender discrimination in healthcare. There is some evidence that context influences the impact of individual level moderators. Finally, there is evidence of gender discrimination against daughters in education. Nationally, girls have lower levels of education than boys in general and sisters have less education than brothers within families. Further, there is evidence of moderating effects from class, female status, religion, and context. Context exerts a strong influence on the gender differential. Communities and regions with higher female status exhibit greater egalitarianism with regard to their children's education. Context also impacts the manner in which the individual level moderators affect the gender differential.","","2022-10-06 23:10:30","2022-10-06 23:10:30","2022-10-06 23:10:30","","211","","","","","Consequences of son preference in India","","","","","State University of New York at Albany","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780542221422","","","","","Social sciences; Education; India; Health care; Daughters; Gender discrimination; Nutrition; Son preference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The clinic includes the professions of chiropractic, acupuncture, physiotherapy, osteopathy and massage therapy, and contains low levels of intra-clinic inter-professional patient referrals among the therapists. The aim of the research project was to investigate whether increased inter-actor professional knowledge sharing among the clinic therapists would lead to augmented levels of intra-clinic inter-professional patient referral rates. The research aims were mainly explored within the academic realm of knowledge management and social identity theory. The research project engaged all the involved therapists in the clinic, and comprised several practical interventions in the organisation, including one-to-one interviews and group sessions. The project represents an initial part of an ongoing organisational process, where the iterative aspects of action learning is practised by way of continued interventions and management initiatives. The research evidenced that the organisation contained several barriers to knowledge sharing, and that these were connected to perceptions of group identity and belonging, partially delineated along conventional professional demarcations. The research further revealed several useful means to enhance knowledge sharing among the therapists in the form of knowledge artefacts, which contributed to enhanced sense of group belonging among the partakers, furthering their knowledge sharing impulse. It was further demonstrated that the enhanced knowledge sharing that resulted from the organisational interventions and new sense of group belonging led to augmented levels of intra-clinic inter-professional patient referrals. The research will inform future practice by way of instigating future knowledge sharing initiatives in the health clinic.

This qualitative research study in a critical phenomenological research paradigm has allowed  me to explore, describe, explain and gain an understanding of the nature of female teachers‟  lived experiences of senior male colleagues‟ exercising of power. It has also allowed me to  critically challenge and question female teachers‟ lived experiences by interpreting and making  meaning or the power conundrum within a school context. Using a qualitative research design  and methodology, I interrogated the power hierarchy in schools by initiating critical dialogue with  the participants. This study serves as a voice for female teachers‟ lived experiences regarding  the power conundrum.  Data was generated by 16 purposefully selected female teachers from various primary and  secondary schools in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda district in the North-West Province, more  specifically the Matlosana area. The data generation phases consist of two consecutive phases  each with different stages. The first phase concerns the photo-elicitation-narratives (written).  This is followed by individual photo-elicitation-interviews during the second phase. The data is  analysed by means of interpretive phenomenology analysis (IPA). Thereafter themes and  categories are identified, and verified during a consensus meeting with independent coders.  Two main themes are identified: Theme one is that female teachers experience power as a  behaviour that has the potential to evoke feelings that are (im)balanced, thus power evokes  feelings of either being nurtured or feelings that are seen as degrading or destructive in nature.  Theme two reflects female teachers‟ suggestions of promoting their own well-being. As wellbeing  evokes a sense of meaningfulness and belonging in the workplace, it can lead to positive  work relationships. When power is misused or abused in the workplace, it results in workplace  bullying and abusive behaviour, which has a negative effect not only on employees‟ work  performance, but also on their personal life and own health. If the detrimental effects of this  phenomenon of power in a school context are ignored, female teachers will continue to  experience loss of self-esteem and work withdrawal, and show signs of increased depression  as well as high stress levels.","2014","2022-10-06 23:11:19","2022-10-06 23:11:19","2022-10-06 23:11:19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","Thesis","","","repository.nwu.ac.za","","Accepted: 2016-02-17T07:37:55Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using longitudinal data on the personal computer industry, which is described in chapter two, chapter three identifies the main effects and complex interplay of two attributes of a firm's role in a system of competitive relations: (a) its size relative to that of its structurally equivalent rivals and (b) its level of diversification. The results show first that, net of absolute size, relative size raises sales growth; second, that the main effect of scope is positive; and third, that the effect of scope follows an inverted U-shaped pattern over the distribution of relative size. Diversification thus lowers growth when firms are relatively small, raises growth after a threshold before a maximum, but has a negative effect again for extreme levels of relative size. Theories of diversification, which have been disparate historically, are integrated and jointly find support in the analysis. Chapter four then addresses the following question: When is a social actor most strongly influenced by its peers? This chapter's results clarify when firms were most strongly affected by the choices of their closest rivals to adopt a well-known technology: Intel's sixth generation processor. Extending prior research on social networks and firm survival chances, it is hypothesized that the effect of adoptions by strategically similar organizations rises with the competitive pressure to which a focal firm is subject. The results then show that the effect of the conduct of comparable firms is greatest on those facing scale-based competition without the advantages of targeting a narrowly defined set of customers. The main implications of these results are that a contingent theory of social influence may be necessary to portray diffusion processes correctly in competitive contexts, and that an actor's sensitivity to the conduct of others may depend not only on its place in an internal hierarchy but also on the nature of its connections to an external audience.","","2022-10-06 23:11:27","2022-10-06 23:11:27","2022-10-06 23:11:27","","110","","","","","","","","","","Columbia University","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493862293","","","","","Social sciences; Social networks; Firm growth; Computer industry; Economic performance; Structural position; Technology adoption","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Middle-level managers play critical roles in facilitating organizational changes (Rouleau, 2005), mediating knowledge gaps in organizations (Burgess & Currie, 2013), and promoting strategic renewal in organizations (Wooldridge, Schmid & Floyd, 2008). As local leaders, they make sense of their experiences and give signals to the employees to construct shared meaning in the given context (Kezar 2013). Despite their vital roles and significant contributions, little is known about the perceptions and lived experiences of middle managers in government organizations (Chen, Berman & Wang, 2017). Through the lens of sensemaking theory (Weick, 1995), this study explored how Deans and Directors at a highly-structured government institute understand their positions and lived experiences as middle managers between senior level leaders and faculty members. Through the framework of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), the research data revealed that middle managers orient themselves as (a) mediators of expectations, (b) influencers of people, (c) balancing wheels of organizations, and (d) generators of collective efficacy. The voices of the participants shed light on how they understand their positions and construct self-concepts in hierarchical organizational contexts. The findings from this study offered fresh insight into managerial discourse for government organizations, highlighting middle managers’ realities from relational perspectives.","","2022-10-06 23:20:14","2022-10-06 23:20:14","2022-10-06 23:20:14","","175","","","","","Managerial Sensemaking and Sensegiving","","","","","Northeastern University","United States -- Massachusetts","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781392053119","","","","","Social sciences; Government organizations; IPA; Lived experiences; Middle managers; Sensegiving; Sensemaking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of the analysis is to show that while industrialization was initiated by specific classes in power, it, in fact, restructured these classes by establishing a new dominant class. The study analyzes the concept of class (defined in terms of control over economic ownership and possession) as applied to the Algerian industrial structure comprising the state and private sectors. It is argued that the two sectors are characterized by the same relations of production, capitalist relations, and that they are controlled by the same class: the industrial bourgeoisie. The approaches of dependency, noncapitalist path and state capitalism are rejected as inadequate in explaining the character of the Algerian social formation because they neglect the real class relations in the state and private sectors. It is argued instead that a newly formed dominant class, the industrial bourgeoisie, is leading a course of independent capitalist development.","","2022-10-06 23:20:20","2022-10-06 23:20:20","2022-10-06 23:20:20","","217","","","","","","","","","","American University","United States -- District of Columbia","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798205250153","","","","","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"PQWBZ5P5","thesis","","Arnold, John Charles","Ego sum Michael: The origin and diffusion of the Christian cult of St. Michael the Archangel","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304334770/abstract/E339E232EC9B456BPQ/1","Despite the vast importance of angels in Christian cosmological constructs as well as their role in the economy of salvation, English-speaking scholars in particular have ignored the subject. The dissertation examines the formation and diffusion of the Christian cult of St. Michael the Archangel prior to 813 CE, the year in which the Council of Mainz recognized the Archangel's efficacy as a universal intercessor. This study views the cult as a paradigm for exploring the broader topic of the construction of a Christian angelology. A purely Christian cult originated within the discursive and ritual traditions of late antique ecumenical angelic reverence. From a confluence of disparate ideas emerged a devotion which sought healing, guardianship and intercession from the Archangel at healing springs and caves. By the mid-fourth century a Christian cult of Michael had taken root in Phrygia, Egypt and Constantinople in response to local needs, imperial patronage and the Arian controversy. A theory of independent multiple origins for the cult explains its sudden diffusion better than accepted paradigms of substitution or liturgical accretion. The roles of angels in the liturgy provided a mechanism by which Christians reinterpreted landscape features as re-presentations of the Holy Sepulchre. Michael symbolized the Resurrection as did Gabriel the Incarnation. Consequently, nunneries in Merovingian Gaul linked Michael with a reverence for the True Cross as an anti-Arian devotional strategy. Scholars have ignored the Merovingian evidence, favoring outdated theories which credit the Irish with transalpine diffusion of the cult. The Franks associated the feast day not with Irish, but with papal practice and included Roman festival propers in their sacramentaries. Michael's recognition in 813 as a universal intercessor acknowledged his protection of the ""adopted Israelites"" in Francia. This dissertation addresses the actual mechanisms of late antique religious syncretism, posits new theories for the formation of saintly cults and informs as to the details of a major saintly cult previously unexplored by Anglo-American scholars.","","2022-10-06 23:23:48","2022-10-06 23:23:48","2022-10-06 23:23:48","","384","","","","","Ego sum Michael","","","","","University of Arkansas","United States -- Arkansas","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780591605266","","","","","Social sciences; Philosophy; religion and theology; Saint; Michael the Archangel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It appraises the work of Herbert Simon and his claims for the primacy of hierarchy in the organization of systems. It also discusses the ways in which the work of Bertrand Russell, specifically the theory of types, and Alfred Tarski, specifically the object language--metalanguage distinction, have been misunderstood as being relevant to questions of systems organization. Claims of hierarchical organization in computer systems are also considered. In addition, it is pointed out that systems can be conceptualized in different ways and that although some of those conceptualizations are hierarchies, others are not. Different definitions of ""hierarchy"" that are currently used are discussed. Finally, several non-hierarchical complex systems are considered. The dissertation concludes that Russell and Tarski are relevant to discussions of hierarchy only in the most general way--namely that the ontology of Logical Atomism supports both hierarchical organizational forms and the systems developed by Russell and Tarski. It also points out that an a priori commitment to hierarchical organization may result in a failure to recognize other, heuristically valuable organizational models.","","2022-10-06 23:23:56","2022-10-06 23:23:56","2022-10-06 23:23:56","","308","","","","","","","","","","Temple University","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798208652480","","","","","Applied sciences; Philosophy; religion and theology; computer organization; systems organization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, service quality management is a primary need for business survival. Quality management has been recognized as a comprehensive management philosophy for improving organisational performance and competitiveness. The effective adoption of an appropriate service quality management system in an organisation can facilitate the achievement of excellence in service quality. Furthermore, service excellence is a crucial factor in the achievement of a high level of customer satisfaction in service organisations like banks. Therefore, the main aim of this research is to investigate the factors affecting the excellence of service quality in the developing banking sector in Syria. The fundamental concepts of excellence of the EFQM Excellence Model have been borrowed from the literature as a theoretical framework through which to investigate the Syrian Banking Sector (SBS). To achieve the research aim, an interpretevist philosophy has been adopted as the means of understanding in depth, the factors influencing excellence in three case study organisations, which are selected to be representative of the state-owned banks (CSOA), private banks (CSOB), and Islamic private banks (CSOC). Different sources of data collection – semi-structured interviews, direct observation, archival records, and documentation - are used to achieve triangulation of the results. The main contribution to knowledge of this research can be summarised fundamentally as: firstly designing a theoretical framework embracing the factors affecting the excellence of service quality in the Syrian banking sector. Secondly, conducting a comparative reserch approach between the three (CSOs) investigating the factors affecting the readiness to implement EFQM excellence model in each case study. The main findings have revealed that CSOC is more likely to achieve excellence than the other two banks, since CSOC has demonstrated consistent progress towards that aim. In respect of CSOA and CSOB, it is clear that certain negative managerial practices need to be remedied before the EFQM Excellence Model can seriously be pursued. In addition, some unique factors have emerged, such as the intensive intervention of guardian authorities for the state-owned bank, the negative effect of religion and culture on employee performance in the state-owned bank, and the lack of banking culture in Syria in general. Furthermore, the research enriches the literature through the comparative dimension highlighted in the three case studies (state-owned, private, and private Islamic banks) since there are limitations in the literature regarding the readiness to implement the EFQM excellence model in the service sector, and particularly in banks in the developing countries.","2014","2022-10-06 23:27:21","2022-10-06 23:27:21","2022-10-06 23:27:21","","403","","","","","","","","","","University of Salford (United Kingdom)","England","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798505518687","","","","","Management; Banking; Finance; Competition; Marketing; Research methodology; Banking industry; Customer services; Partnership agreements; Product development; Total quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"GHKDVXIB","thesis","2009","Assalama, Iman","Triggers and Conditions for Innovations in Dubai","","","","","https://bspace.buid.ac.ae/handle/1234/254","The dissertation was set out to get a thorough understanding of innovation in  general, the different factors that may trigger the adoption of the innovation, and the  conditions required in the organization to ensure the innovation’s success. The  dissertation aims to enhance the level of innovation in the United Arab Emirates’  organizations, and specifically in Dubai’s organizations. This can be established  through the understanding of the main triggers and conditions that are associated  with successful innovations in Dubai’s organizations. Provided that innovation is  claimed to survive organizations through tough market situations, this dissertation  seemed timely due to the current global credit crunch crisis. Considering the  importance of this topic and its different dimensions, mixed approach research was  selected for this dissertation. The surveys and interviews were conducted  concurrently to collect different information and data from both targeted populations.  The findings of the dissertation revealed several external triggers for innovation in  Dubai’s organizations, such as the client’s demand and the market conditions. The  suggested internal triggers were management’s characteristics, and vision. The  proposed organizational conditions that seemed associated with successful  innovations were the organization’s culture, climate, structure, employee  empowerment, and the allocation of innovation champion. On the one hand, Dubai’s  organizations seemed to associate innovation significantly with the organization’s  climate, staff empowerment, and the allocation of innovation champion. On the other  hand, innovation in Dubai’s organizations seemed to be specifically dependent on the  level of staff empowerment, and a positive organizational climate. The dissertation  was concluded with a set of recommendations to improve the main organizational  conditions that are associated with innovation. This included : guidelines on  emplacing an appropriate staff empowerment, setting an “Enterprise Integration  Group” to align the organizational climate with the organization’s direction, proposed  different approaches on allocating innovation champions, and finally, additional  recommendations included different suggestions on enhancing the organizational  culture, management skills, and employee development.","2009-03","2022-10-06 23:27:31","2022-10-06 23:27:36","2022-10-06 23:27:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","bspace.buid.ac.ae","","Accepted: 2013-07-09T09:38:10Z Publisher: British University in Dubai","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I focus on Asian Indian Patels, who dominate the budget motel business in the United States. I conducted semi-structured interviews with Patel men, women, and teenagers. I stayed overnight in the motels to observe families at work. I was almost always invited to prepare and share a meal, so I observed families at home. My analysis is based on transcribed interviews with participants, fieldnotes, observations, community publications, and information from three key contacts. Most Patels enter the U.S. under family reunification rules in a chain migration. These rules do not recognize families as labor; therefore a majority of documented immigrants are exempt from labor certification. Traditions define Patel women as housewives. The nature of motel work allows women to contribute their labor full-time and still remain housewives: they are not recognized as workers. Community financing and family labor, both escapes from the market economy, allow for the economic success of Patels. When families take on subsequent links in the chain migration, they must meet the costs of migration for new immigrants, and maintain traditional gender hierarchy. When they are the last link in the chain, there is a challenge to this hierarchy. In the second generation, when they remain in the motel business, Patels maintain traditional gender hierarchy. When either partner is linked to the labor market, there is a challenge to traditional gender hierarchy.","","2022-10-06 23:27:52","2022-10-06 23:27:52","2022-10-06 23:27:52","","222","","","","","Gender hierarchy among Gujarati immigrants","","","","","Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University","United States -- Virginia","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780496670826","","","","","Social sciences; Ethnic norms; Gender hierarchy; Gujarati; Immigrants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Deficits in integrated caretaking often result in hospital readmission. Aim: The aim of this thesis was to describe and analyze preconditions for collaboration and participation in integrated care for frail older people from the professionals’ perspective. Methods: In study I patient participation was examined with a case study, including face-to-face interviews with health and social care professionals and audio-recordings of discharge planning conferences. Study II explored inter-professional and inter-organizational collaboration using a focus group technique, focusing discharge planning conferences. Study III was quantitative, and described and compared the influence of different factors on the importance of inter-organizational collaboration within  the integrated care process program “Continuum of care for frail older people.” Study IV quantitatively evaluated the preconditions for implementation of the program. Results: Study I showed that frail older people’s participation in discharge planning conferences was achieved when the older people took or were supported to be active participants, the professionals had clear roles, authority, they created a structured, calm atmosphere, and older people and professionals were well prepared before discharge planning takes place. Study II demonstrated that conflict in collaboration arose between professionals and organizations, implicating a tacit framework, e.g. who is responsible and has the authority to make decisions and what are the prioritizations in relation to the choice of care actions for older people. In Study III, educational level i.e. post-secondary education, influenced inter-organizational collaboration more than organizational affiliation. Study IV showed that the preconditions for the program implementation were limited with regard to the professionals’ understanding and ability to change their work procedure, and their commitment decreased. Conclusion: Inter-professional and inter-organizational collaboration need improvements to ensure a continuum of high-quality care and frail older people’s participation in the discharge process. Insufficient knowledge among the professionals obstructed collaboration in favor of organizationally related norms and values and professional boundaries. Implementing complex interventions in organizations with high employee turnover and competing projects takes time and dedication.","2018-10-26","2022-10-06 23:29:14","2022-10-06 23:29:44","2022-10-06 23:29:14","","","","","","","Collaborative challenges in integrated care","","","","","","","eng","","","","","gupea.ub.gu.se","","Accepted: 2018-10-26T13:28:11Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"K28TNY8L","thesis","2019","Baniamin, Hasan Muhammad","Relationships among Governance Quality, Institutional Performance, and (Dis)Trust: Trends and Tensions: A Quest for Critical Ingredients of Institutional Trust","","","","","https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/handle/1956/20574","This dissertation analyzes institutional trust, first, in the three South Asian countries of Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, and then in 32 African countries. These countries were chosen in order to explore why citizens in developing countries trust public institutions despite those institutions’ poor performance. Most of the existing literature on institutional trust indicates that trust in public institutions is contingent on institutional performance and governance quality. This view accords with the rational choice theory and the logic of consequences, with the argument that citizens will evaluate better performance and governance positively, and poor performance and bad governance negatively. These evaluations should be reflected in the citizens’ trust in government institutions. Based on this logic, governmental organizations and agencies, for instance those in OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries, should enjoy higher institutional trust than do such organizations and agencies that perform poorly, examples being those in non- OECD countries. This is because various public institutions in OECD countries, when they are compared with similar institutions in non-OECD countries, have generally higher performance in a number of areas, for instance in the health and education sectors, and they have better governance. However, certain cross-country surveys (e.g., the World Values Survey and the European Values Study) indicate that public institutions in a number of non- OECD countries, despite their lower performance and poor governance, enjoy higher institutional trust than do comparable institutions in OECD countries. The ‘logic of consequences’ then becomes questionable as an explanatory variable of institutional trust, and the use of rational choice theory becomes problematic as a theoretical lens through which to explain the same phenomenon. This is the point of departure for this dissertation. The articles in this dissertation propose that along with the consequential logic of rational choice theory, additional explanatory variables may be required to explain the empirical inconsistency of inflated trust in the public institutions of under-performing countries. The proposed variable is based on a cultural attribute, more specifically, authoritarian cultural orientation (ACO). This cultural attribute is tested through a country-representative survey called the Governance and Trust Survey 2 (GoT 2), which was administered in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Thereafter, the effects of a similar kind of cultural orientation are explored in 32 African countries using survey data from Afro-barometer. The proposed cultural norm measured by ACO indicates something about people’s degree of unquestioning obedience to authority. People who have higher ACO tend to have a higher degree of institutional trust. This cultural aspect is related to social values and norms, obligations, and commitment, which together are referred to as the ‘logic of appropriateness’, as described by March and Olsen (1996 and 1998). The first three articles in this dissertation explore the importance of the logic of appropriateness in combination with the logic of consequences in explaining institutional trust. Among these three articles, the first two use ACO to try to explain trust in the civil service, while the third tries to explain trust in various other institutions such as the parliament, the police, and the judicial court. All these articles confirm that ACO matters in explaining institutional trust in the sampled countries. In the third article, one key finding is that higher education can contribute to reducing ACO. Education may increase people’s cognitive ability, encourage them to become more assertive, and to question authorities and their actions. This may help reduce the degree of unquestioning obedience, which is the indicator of ACO. Interestingly, the second article finds that people with higher ACO usually assess civil servants positively; they have a comparatively strong belief that civil servants are prompt, efficient, and tend to treat people equally. In the fourth article, which analyzes the same phenomenon in 32 African countries also found that people with higher education have lower institutional trust. Like the articles on South Asia, the fourth article confirms that people with lower assertiveness have higher institutional trust. The relation between low assertiveness and institutional trust therefore parallels the relation between ACO and institutional trust. The fourth article also indicates that people with lower assertiveness believe their country has less governance-related problems (e.g., corruption or unfair treatment) than do people with higher assertiveness. Similarly, people with lower assertiveness think their country is doing better in different performance indicators such as management of the economy and the creation of employment. The focus of the fifth article is slightly different. It tries to explain why the Nepalese anticorruption agency has higher trust than the similar agencies of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka – despite the fact that all three countries are characterized by a relatively high level of corruption. This study finds that the Sri Lankan anti-corruption agency is dormant (few anticorruption interventions1), while the Nepalese and Bangladeshi agencies operate selectively. The Nepalese anti-corruption agency has initiated a number of anti-corruption initiatives against the lower-level officials, particularly against the school teachers with fake academic certificates. These actions make the agency more visible to the general public and convince them that the agency is seriously trying to stamp out corruption. This may contribute to the vii higher institutional trust that it enjoys. Since the Nepalese agency has not taken any major steps to curb the corruption of politicians and higher-level bureaucrats, the overall corruption level is yet to be improved there. In Bangladesh, the anti-corruption agency targets both higher-level and lower-level people in the power structure, but does so selectively, mainly directing its attention to members of the opposition party. Thus, this article indicates that perceived performance, which may vary from real performance, may affect institutional trust. The last article is about the possible problem of having an incentive system for credence goods. Credence goods are goods which involve information asymmetry between service providers and consumers. In this situation of information asymmetry, service providers know more about the required nature or quality and quantity of the services than do the consumers. Health services are a good example. In such situations, consumers must depend on the trustworthiness of service providers, and this dependency can make service recipients vulnerable to monetary exploitation. By analyzing the childbirth delivery system of Bangladesh, the study finds that private clinics have a higher level of overtreatment problems (e.g., caesarian delivery without proper medical grounds) than do government and NGO health facilities. This is because private clinics have more incentive to capitalize on information asymmetry, due to their dependency on the earnings from the services they provide.","2019-06-14","2022-10-06 23:29:26","2022-10-06 23:29:26","2022-10-06 23:29:26","","","","","","","Relationships among Governance Quality, Institutional Performance, and (Dis)Trust","","","","","The University of Bergen","","eng","Copyright the author.

It does so by examining diffusion under conditions of international hierarchy and how diffusion impacts state formation. Given that many approaches to international theory assume an autochthonously constituted ""West"" there is a tendency to ignore how diffusion from the global periphery impacts Western state formation. At the same time, histories of empire-building or hegemony remain largely unexplored to uncover transnational processes of innovation and diffusion. Taking both claims as starting points, this project investigates how international hierarchy (as either imperialism or hegemony) has historically resulted in the experimentation and innovation of various norms and practices that impact state-formation of various imperial or hegemonic powers. I show that imperial spaces are as much spaces of experimentation and social innovation as spaces of exploitation. These spaces produce norms and practices not only in the periphery but also in the metropole. I examine three case of where these imperial or hegemonic reverberations influence state institutions. First, I trace genealogically the materialization of the concentration camp and how it was applied in Europe before the second world war. Second, I look at the emergence of the modern surveillance state as the product of imperial innovations in India and the Philippines. Third, I focus on the application and experimentation of neoliberalism in Chile during the 1970s. Lastly, I explain how under contemporary conditions of American hegemony and the past decade of the Global War on Terror, we can see American experiences abroad reshaping the domestic sphere in various ways.","","2022-10-06 23:31:08","2022-10-06 23:31:08","2022-10-06 23:31:07","","193","","","","","Empire within","","","","","The Johns Hopkins University","United States -- Maryland","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781267913043","","","","","Social sciences; Hierarchy; Violence; Experimentation; Modernity; Empire; State formation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With an estimated volume  output growth of 85% by 2030, it is going to register an increase of a $6 trillion in its value.  The construction industry is a vital industry to achieve economic prosperity. Nonetheless,  Tunisia, among other developing countries, is facing some barriers, affecting its construction  companies’ performance, specifically when it comes to quality and cultural practices.  In 2013, this dynamic industry is contributing by 7% to the Tunisian GDP ($3.3 billion),  employing 3,555 people in total, and is expected to grow by 1.54% in the next four years.  Nevertheless, this industry is facing a competitiveness problem. With only 11.2% of ISO  9001 certified companies, this industry is lacking some quality practices.  The review of literature has demonstrated the relevance of the QMS and ISO 9001  certification in construction. They enhance companies’ performance, by ensuring cost  efficiency and customer satisfaction. However, implementing such a system does not  necessarily validate its effectiveness. Previous studies have shown that the organizational  culture is underrated in this field, while it is a critical component of ensuring the success of  the implementation of QMS.  The objective of this thesis is to answer the following questions that arise from this context:  - What is the construction companies’ effectiveness in achieving the principles of ISO  9001 in Tunisia?  - What is the impact of the implementation of QMS by construction companies on its  performance?  - What are the principal barriers to the implementation of the ISO 9001 in Tunisia?  The methodology used, in this context, includes a primary research of the ISO 9001 practices  in the global market, and a survey distributed to 15 ISO 9001 certified Tunisian companies  working in construction. It identified the barriers related to this matter, examines the current  status of the QMS implementation. A specific company was then selected to evaluate the  contribution of ISO 9001 certification towards achieving its qualitative objectives in quality  management and its financial performance. This assessment has been effectuated based on the  most relevant tangible and intangible KPIs of the company. The outcomes from this research  led to a set of recommendations that would help companies in the Tunisian construction  industry improve the effectiveness of their QMS and enhance their customer satisfaction and  their competitiveness.","2016-06","2022-10-06 23:31:17","2022-10-06 23:31:17","2022-10-06 23:31:17","","","","","","","Assessing the implementation of quality management system ISO 9001","","","","","","","eng","embargoedAccess","masterThesis","","","run.unl.pt","","Accepted: 2016-08-05T09:08:16Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It tests the hypothesis that the doctrine of the Trinity can be applied to the question in such a way that a paradigm for pastoral care emerges. The context for the study was the author's need for a working model for her own practice when ordained. It therefore employs a postmodern epistemology. It proceeds by correlating the results of a literature search in three areas and basing its conclusions on the result. The areas examined are The Trinity, contemporary anthropology and pastoral care. All are found to be inherently relational. Their shared relationality is taken to support the claims that human relationships may be patterned on divine relationships, and that (Christian) pastoral care should display the core features of Trinitarian life. Three core features of Trinitarian life are then ascertained by examining the features of a diagrammatic representation of Trinity that has been adopted in the course of the argument. When translated into the language of human behaviour these are Encounter Empathy and Empowerment. 'By-products' of the research process include critique of the use of gendered language for God and of an immanent-transcendent dualism. It is also recommended that the category 'being for' should be added to 'being' and 'doing' when describing pastoral conduct, and that all three parameters in the new pastoral care paradigm will ideally be present in a balanced form.","1999-10","2022-10-06 23:31:32","2022-10-06 23:31:36","2022-10-06 23:31:32","","","","","","","Care in Trinity","","","","","","","en","","","","","chesterrep.openrepository.com","","Accepted: 2010-08-27T14:18:44Z Publisher: University of Liverpool (Chester College of Higher Education)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The socialisation of the cadets is contextualised within the broad aim of the global and national regulations of MET to develop competent seafarers. In the international seafaring labour market, there is an increasing trend of labour participation of seafarers coming from the ‘new labour supplying countries’ (NLSCs). The Philippines is seen by industry insiders to be one of the top NLSCs for officers. However, the academic literature is silent about the experiences of officer cadets of their education and training especially those coming from NLSCs.  Using multi-modal data collection tools such as in-depth interviews, field notes and document analysis, this qualitative study examines the experiences of the current and former cadets under the sponsored cadetship programs (SCPs) in the Philippines in order to analyse first-hand experiences of MET.  The key findings of this thesis are: (a) SCPs are officer training platforms developed mainly by shipping companies to meet their sea-based labour needs and intended to comply with the Philippine standards of MET; (b) there are a variety of SCPs from which four models are described in this study;  (c) SCPs utilise a ritualistic socialisation of cadets in college campus as key mechanism of training; and (d) there is a diversity of shipboard training experiences of cadets ranging from well-planned training programs to the complete absence of programs.  The thesis concludes the following: (a) the quality of training experienced by the cadets is characterised as a highly regulated and reinforced professionalization process intent on producing certificated officers; (b) the SCPs are routes for migrant work for mainly male Filipinos being guaranteed a post-collegiate sea-based employment by their shipping patrons; (c) the socialisation of the cadets is influenced by processes of globalisation embodied in the global standards of MET enforced locally, and the role of international shipping companies in funding the recruitment and training of cadets as well as offering them post-training employment;  and (d) in spite of global and local standards of MET, there is no common or shared understanding of the notion of seafaring competence among the trainers, which have affected the way competencies were taught and assessed.","2016-03","2022-10-06 23:32:39","2022-10-06 23:32:39","2022-10-06 23:32:39","","343","","","","","","","","","","Cardiff University","","en","","phd","","","orca.cardiff.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been argued that the time has come to rethink the nature of early Asian complex societies. After a half a century of archaeological investigations, virtually no new insights have been made about early South Indian social organization in the time period between 300 BC and AD 300—a shortcoming that may be attributed to two factors: (1) a tendency to use traditional hierarchical social classification schemes without first critically examining their relevance to the particular historical developments in early South India and (2) a preference for broad, regional interpretations of the material culture at the expense of finer scales of analysis. To counter these limitations, this study examines the suitability of alternative paradigms of complexity—specifically heterarchy—using a “bottom-up” approach. The hypothesis under investigation is that there existed in early Tamilakam a system of sub-regional localized communities that had would have been invisible in earlier region-wide interpretations of the material culture. The results of the fieldwork, based on two seasons of survey in the state of Kerala, suggest that this is indeed did the case, and that two key strategies led to these results: (1) a critical approach to the relationship between the historical and archaeological records from early Tamilakam and (2) a willingness to evaluate emergent Tamil social complexity using a definition of “complexity” that falls outside evolutionary stage models. The application of the heterarchical model to the archaeological data is supported by the Tamil documentary record, which describes a society structured around a series of physiographic zones, each with its own system of adaptation. This project concentrated on recovering the archaeological remains of one of these zones—the Palghat Gap, a mountain pass in Tamilakam. The findings support the argument that, while regional Tamil polities may have been structured loosely as hierarchical polities, these polities were rooted within a system of pervasive sociopolitical heterarchy at the local level.","","2022-10-06 23:32:45","2022-10-06 23:32:45","2022-10-06 23:32:45","","338","","","","","Social complexity in early Tamilakam","","","","","University of Pennsylvania","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493928609","","","","","Social sciences; India; Social complexity; Ceramics; Kerala; Palghat Gap; Tamilakam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Organisational culture determines how employees communicate with one another and also with various stakeholders. It also determines how, and at what rate certain tasks are performed. Understanding the culture within an organisation can help to determine why the organisation excels in certain tasks, but fails in others. It can also assist an organisation in understanding where strengths and weaknesses are present and what needs to be changed accordingly in order to see improvements. Commitment can be regarded as a component of organisational culture.  The aim of this study was to assess certain aspects of organisational culture, including employee commitment within a municipality. Various models are available to assess and evaluate organisational culture. Although these models are diverse in their scope, they do have certain common elements. Six common elements emerged: innovation and creativity, leadership, participation in decision-making, organisational structure, communication and productivity. The commitment of employees to the organisation was also explored as an element of organisational culture.  Quantitative and qualitative research was undertaken for this research paper. The quantitative research made use of an existing internal staff survey and secondary data were therefore used in this regard. The qualitative research made use of a focus group. The questions used for the focus group were derived from the internal staff survey.  It is clear from the findings of this study that there is a large disconnect between ground-level staff and senior management with regard to innovation and creativity, leadership, participation in decision-making and commitment. The ordinary employees are of the view that the organisation is innovative and that they are highly committed. However as with many other municipalities, the local municipality has a culture of malicious compliance. In fact, one could argue that strict compliance regulations are proving to be a major deterrent in getting tasks done efficiently and it ultimately also hinders innovation. The local municipality will need to implement a number of changes in order to address these varying views and take corrective action to ensure improved service delivery.","2017-03","2022-10-06 23:33:19","2022-10-06 23:33:19","2022-10-06 23:33:19","","","","","","","An exploratory study of organisational culture and employee commitment","","","","","Stellenbosch : Stellenbosch University","","en_ZA","Stellenbosch University","Thesis","","","scholar.sun.ac.za","","Accepted: 2017-02-15T07:49:27Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The protection of minority shareholders is a primary concern in the area of CG and particularly as defined by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) principles. In Saudi Arabia, CG is a newly introduced regime. Its set of CG principles was initially issued after the first market crash in 2006, which signified the need for appropriate CG standards in Saudi Arabia because minority shareholders suffered catastrophic losses. Moreover, CG legislation in Saudi Arabia is still slowly moving from voluntary to obligatory because family-owned firms, which is the dominant form of incorporation, are stifling corporate growth by their reluctance to open their equity to outside shareholders, as argued by the OECD report of Koldertsova (2011). Hence, the conceptual framework for understanding how Saudi Culture affects minorities is based upon Hofstede’s (1980-2010) Cultural Value Dimension (CVD) model linking societal constructs with the legal and political milieu. Thus, this research sets out to examine this link in relevance to Saudi Culture. In addition, this undertaking will extend, via the second research question, to uncover other factors, such as the legal and political, influencing the level of compliance of listed Saudi corporations with the OECD principles with respect to the protection of minority shareholder rights. The findings of this study provides significant correlations between each of Hofstede’s CVDs: Individualism, Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance, Femininity, and Long Term Orientation and the quality of the exercise of minority shareholders’ rights as defined by the OECD’s principles of CG in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the distribution of each CV dimension was found not to be the same when comparing groups of Majority and Minority shareholders. Hence, the significant correlations expose two different subcultures: an active culture pertaining to Majority shareholders and a passive culture pertaining to Minority shareholders in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the current legal environment guiding the CG procedures in Saudi Arabia was found to attach a low level of significance to minority shareholders in terms of: ease of litigation, establishment of specialised courts, appointment of competent qualified judges in CG commercial cases, and creation of awareness programmes for minority shareholders’ rights. In addition, the lack of a solid constitution was found to weaken popular pressure to safeguard shareholders' rights and promote a block-holding model of corporate control. Hence, due to governmental institutions falling short on their responsibilities, Saudi controlling families can practically be considered as an institution, as indicated by Institutional Theory, and this familial institution is likely to continue to manifest itself in the governance of emerging economic systems such as Saudi Arabia's as its survival is dependent on the institutional context.","2016-04-04","2022-10-06 23:35:03","2022-10-06 23:35:03","2022-10-06 23:35:03","","398","","","","","","","","","","University of Gloucesterhsire","","en","all_rights","phd","","","eprints.glos.ac.uk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, understanding how to secure property remains elusive. This paper attempts to provide a theoretical framework and empirical analysis to unpack the black box of property rights. The framework entails distinguishing between private and public protection and subsequent enforcement mechanisms. Previous findings suggest that informal, cultural rules underlie constraints on government predation. Following this logic, this study asks how contract enforcement is achieved – through formal or informal mechanisms? After controlling for reverse causality, the empirical results suggest that informal cultural mechanisms protect against private predation and support contracting institutions while the formal institutions are insignificant. These results are robust to a variety of model specifications, multiple instrumental variables and a range of control variables.","2012-12-18","2022-10-06 23:43:24","2022-10-06 23:43:24","2022-10-06 23:43:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","Culture; Contract Enforcement; Formal Institutions; Informal Institutions; Property Rights","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2191298","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, sustainable consumption is complex type of decision-making, and “greening” the consumption patterns of consumers is not straightforward. There are many motives that consumers may have for buying environmentally friendly products. In view of that, this dissertation examines individual vs collective culturally congruent motives for sustainable consumption.    The first essay of this dissertation examines the role of horizontal and vertical individualism vs collectivism cultural values (H/V IND-COL) in the relationship between green branding and consumers’ green behavioral intentions (e.g. word-of-mouth intentions, the willingness to pay a premium, and purchase intentions). Consumers’ intentions to purchase green products differ with respect to their cultural backgrounds. The second essay explores how H/V IND-COL cultural values are reflected in consumers’ organic food choice motivations and product perceptions when viewed through the lens of life goals. Consumers’ cultural values and life goals both converge and diverge regarding their organic food-product choices. The third essay examines the role of regulatory focus as a personal motivational construct in determining consumers’ sustainable product-consumption experience in H/V IND-COL cultures. This third essay demonstrates that H/V IND-COL values influence consumers’ prevention-focused and promotion-focused environmental behavior. The fourth essay examines if environmental responsibility as a personal motivational construct mediates the effects of H/V IND-COL cultural values on consumers’ environmental attitudes and purchase intentions. Environmental responsibility not only influences consumers’ environmental behavior but also plays a mediating role between H/V IND-COL cultural values and environmental behavior.    The findings of this dissertation contribute to existing research on cross-cultural sustainable consumption, specifically to the research examining individual vs collective cultural motives of sustainable consumption. The results indicate significant differences between consumers’ sustainable consumption choices in countries whose cultures could be broadly described as “individualistic” and “collectivistic.”  The results of this dissertation have the potential to help companies tailor culturally congruent green marketing and advertising strategies.","2019-12-03","2022-10-07 03:16:01","2022-10-07 03:16:01","2022-10-07 03:16:01","","","","","","","Toward a greener globe","","","","","Vaasan yliopisto","","eng","","doctoralThesis","","","osuva.uwasa.fi","","Accepted: 2019-12-03T04:54:40Z ISBN: 9789524768924 Journal Abbreviation: Kohti vihreämpää maailmaa : kulttuurierojen ymmärtäminen kestävän kulutuksen edistämisen väylänä","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Community is a highly contextualized phenomenon, each manifestation differing from any other because of the time and place in which it forms and the individual lives of its members. Qualitative research methods were chosen because of their strength in dealing with this ambiguity. Observations were conducted at the school during the spring of 1993. In addition, the entire staff and the school principal were interviewed using a life story format. Less demanding interviews were conducted with representatives of the board, parents, and students. Research questions concerned perception of a democratic power structure, recognition of the voice of all members in the curriculum, and the existence of dyadic caring relationships. Data addressing these questions were analyzed from three organizational perspectives: Integration, Differentiation, and Fragmentation. These perspectives respectively hold that organizations can be seen as having a shared culture, being comprised of subcultures, or incorporating ambiguity. Analysis found the principal to have a power-with leadership style that might be described as a developmental variant of democratic. The underlying structure of the community is generated by dyadic caring relationships which are dynamic, interconnecting, and support one another. This phenomenon is vigorous at the core and weakest at the periphery. Accordingly, not all members felt their voices were heard and values articulated. Possible practical implications include the need for reform initiatives and preparation programs to incorporate the understanding that community is formed when individuals, each product of a personal history, connect in dyadic caring relationships. Many reform efforts fail because they expect a uniformity in regards to values that is not consonant with the time and place in which they exist. Its implications for preparation programs are significant in that the level of abstraction and tolerance for ambiguity that community building demands are not reflected in current programs. Parallel studies are needed that examine the nature of community in schools that differ in source of funding, size, and location.","","2022-10-07 03:20:58","2022-10-07 03:20:58","2022-10-07 03:20:58","","255","","","","","","","","","","Northwestern University","United States -- Illinois","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798209054825","","","","","social relationships; Education; narrative","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These two cases highlight a critical juncture where the U.S. Army became the lead federal agency in imperial and domestic disaster relief and established a precedent that lasted well into the twentieth century. By declaring martial law, directly overseeing relief efforts, and plugging into existing social hierarchies, the Army and local elites completely reconstructed the political, economic, and social order of both locales. As this was a relatively new role for the Army, they relied on the local social hierarchy as a matter of expediency because of the absence of any existing doctrine to guide their disaster relief efforts. These Army relief efforts culminated in fostering two antidemocratic governments: a colonial regime in Puerto Rico and the first commission-style government in Galveston that upheld Jim Crow policies that were eventually replicated throughout the United States.","2022","2022-10-07 03:38:31","2022-10-07 03:38:31","2022-10-07 03:38:31","15-36","","1","13","","","A Tale of Two Storms","","","","","","","","","","","","Project MUSE","","Publisher: Marine Corps University Press","","","","","disaster relief; imperialism; Puerto Rico; Galveston; Jim Crow; U.S. Army","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of these decisions involves the organization of production in terms of the number of layers of management the ﬁrm decides to employ. Using detailed employer-employee matched data and ﬁrm production quantity and input data for Portuguese ﬁrms, we study the endogenous response of revenue-based and quantity-based productivity to a change in layers: a ﬁrm reorganization. We show that as a result of an exogenous demand or productivity shock that makes the ﬁrm reorganize and add a management layer, quantity based productivity increases by about 4%, while revenue-based productivity drops by more than 4%. Such a reorganization makes the ﬁrm more productive, but also increases the quantity produced to an extent that lowers the price charged by the ﬁrm and, as a result, its revenue-based productivity.","","2022-10-07 03:55:04","2022-10-07 03:55:04","","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing from prior literature on informal hierarchies, this dissertation highlights two key problems that restrain our theoretical understanding of informal hierarchies. First, little is known about when and why groups develop weaker or stronger informal hierarchies. Second, both theory and findings on the consequences of in informal hierarchy strength are contradictory with studies showing both positive and negative effects on performance outcomes. The present dissertation addresses both these issues, by identifying antecedents of informal hierarchy strength; and studying its conditional relationship with team performance and team creativity. In doing so, this dissertation enriches our understanding of the nomological network and will help organizations to more effectively deal with issues around hierarchical organization.","2020","2022-10-07 04:02:24","2022-10-07 04:02:24","","","","","","","","Informal hierarchy","","","","","University of Groningen, SOM research school","[Groningen]","","","Thesis fully internal (DIV)","","","the University of Groningen research portal","","ISBN: 9789403423623 DOI: 10.33612/diss.116926970","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Grounded in family systems theory, the book provides readers with a unique lens through which to better understand the structures of, and processes within, black families. Through interaction with valuable literature and nuanced perspectives, readers learn to embrace a multidimensional perspective of black family life.  The text begins by presenting theory, history, and methods of engaging in research with black family life. Chapters explore belief systems and contextual influences, including perspectives on fatherhood, the dynamics of military and interracial families, and the effects of mass incarceration on black families. The text examines family processes and structures, addressing racial socialization, marriage, divorce, interfaith relationships, and more. Readers learn about mental health and well-being from a clinician's perspective and how economics and politics impact black families systems. The final section speaks to the future, with suggestions for expanding and improving research, practice, theory, and policy related to black family life.  Featuring relevant social inquiry and scholarly perspective, Black Families is an ideal textbook for courses that explore family theories and diverse family systems and structures.Anthony G.

Family life represents a set of customs that have evolved in the context of history and in response to adverse factors in the environment. This suggests that inherent in informal instruction about family life is the implied responsibility of accomplishing cultural goals. The purpose of this study was to examine: (1) how does the Black Baptist church preserve African American culture and family life? (2) how is family life taught through rituals and symbolic roles in the Black Church? and (3) how do Vygotsky's theory and concepts explain the cultural and cognitive process of passing on instruction for family life? Ethnographic field methods were used to both collect and analyze data. The data consisted of twenty-six informant interviews, a series of thirty observations of Black Church scenarios, and a Women's Christian conference address. Findings revealed that underlying the social and historical process in the Black Church is an African worldview in which knowledge about family life is constructed as a shared experience with the community of believers. This shared experience is one in which ritual specialists, the pastor, ministers, deacons and church mothers become key transmitters of culture and teachers of family life education. The implications of these findings are that parent education may be embedded in a social context and that parenting, as a body of knowledge, lies within the larger pattern of cultural goals and values. The idea that learning occurs through the performance of ritual suggests that where parenting is taught is just as important as how it is taught. Implications for family educators working with African American families are: (1) the Black Church provides a culturally-approved context and model of instruction (2) knowledge about family life may be embedded in the larger pattern of African American cultural goals and values and (3) spirituality undergirds the learning that transforms religious rituals into social rituals that become successful patterns for family life.","","2022-10-08 03:58:10","2022-10-08 03:58:10","2022-10-08 03:58:10","","194","","","","","Another day's journey in the life of a Black church","","","","","University of Minnesota","United States -- Minnesota","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780591092318","","","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the one hand there is modernist antihumanism, perhaps most overtly presented in the writings of Georgian avant-garde intellectual T. E. Hulme. In his posthumously published Cinders, Hulme, perhaps the most analytical spokesperson for antihumanism in the months preceding the publication of Wyndham Lewis's Blast, referred to his philosophy as the “Valet to the Absolute” (19). Hulme and his antihumanist contemporaries in Georgian London, most notably Pound and Lewis, were servants to this Absolute, an absolute that was set in opposition to life—cacophonous, multifarious, amorphous life. This antihumanism is by no means an abberration among the Georgian avant-garde; an examination of a journal like The Egoist reveals just how widespread these attitudes were among artists and intellectuals. It was artists like Wyndham Lewis, with their roots in the antihumanist millieu of the Geogian avant-garde, who became oriented positively in various ways to fascism through what Frederic Jameson has labeled “protofascism.” For Lewis, protofascist ideology was the corrective to “degeneracy,” to cacophonous mulifariousness, to democracy's egalitarian mediocrity, to familial sentimentality—in short, the corrective to the offensiveness (from his perspective) of concrete, quotidian and multifarious humanity as it actually dares to exist. In contrast, Rebecca West, a contributor to Lewis's Blast, represents a modernist trajectory that defends the value of the concrete, quotidian individual in the West, in all of his or her organic imperfection and finitude. This strand of modernism does not want to dispense with the tradition of humanism; rather, this trajectory wants to extend radically the value of individual human lives as the cornerstone of political, social, and aesthetic reference.","","2022-10-08 04:01:40","2022-10-08 04:01:40","2022-10-08 04:01:40","","236","","","","","Closed fists, open hands","","","","","University of Notre Dame","United States -- Indiana","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780599516571","","","","","Ezra; Ezra Pound; Hulme; Language; Lewis; Literary; literature and linguistics; Modernism; Pound; Protofascism; Radical humanism; Rebecca; Rebecca West; Rhetorics; T.

In addition to allowing the therapist to engage in a variety of strategies, group therapy provides models of behavior, role play for rehearsal, and a system for companionship for clients of all ages. For children, a group provides a lifelike representation of their everyday world, providing unique opportunities for them to interact with peers about their feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. As with adults, there are advantages and disadvantages of doing group work with children, and the therapist must make important decisions about the nature of the group before beginning. This creative component thesis examines group therapy in general and its application with children in specific. The information gathered provides the basis for the development, implementation, and evaluation of a child therapy group conducted by the author. This group was attended by five children, lasted for eight weeks, and involved several therapeutic strategies and approaches.","","2022-10-08 04:25:48","2022-10-08 04:25:48","2022-10-08 04:25:48","","76","","","","","","","","","","University of Alaska Anchorage","United States -- Alaska","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.S.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780599004320","","","","","Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Boundary regulation, a family task defined in terms of proximity and generation hierarchy, is believed to be the most critical to family functioning because it sets a precondition for the execution of other family tasks. Data from Wave II of the National Survey of Families and Household (NSFH) were used to identify family interaction patterns that reflect proximity and generation hierarchy aspects of boundary regulation, utilizing both parent and adolescent responses. Proximity was measured by items representing physical and emotional closeness of family members, while generation hierarchy was measured by reciprocal role enactment by parents and adolescent children. Exploratory principal component factor analysis was performed separately for parents and adolescents, to identify the items loading on the proximity and generation hierarchy. Second-order factor analysis, performed to further reduce the factors, combined proximity and generation hierarchy to form the family functioning variables for the regression analysis. Results indicated that boundary regulation was a strong predictor of academic performance and that second order factors were better predictors of academic performance for both the parents and adolescents. Contribution and significance of the findings to the field of family studies and to the general academic performance literature were discussed. Suggestions for further research as well as the implication of the research findings for policy in family life education and school and community interventions were also outlined.","","2022-10-08 04:31:23","2022-10-08 04:31:23","2022-10-08 04:31:23","","132","","","","","Effects of boundary regulation on children's academic performance","","","","","Iowa State University","United States -- Iowa","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780542477874","","","","","Academic performance; Boundary regulation; Children; Education; Family functioning; Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This thesis is concerned with the questions of ""the what and how of HIV/AIDS school education"". This study is located in three secondary schools in Butare-Ville, Rwanda, which were selected to show the picture of current pedagogic practices of fighting the pandemic in various schools. The first part of the study is concerned with the analysis of National policy of HIV/AIDS education of grade 9. This analysis examines how HIV/AIDS education is planned and integrated in various school subjects and what the Ministry of Education's policy is on how it should be implemented. I examined the instructional and regulative discourses within the national policy. Through curricula of other subjects which integrate into HIV/ AIDS education, I also examined how the knowledge of instruction is organized in terms of vertical and horizontal organization. The second part of the study is concerned with how the National HIV/AIDS Policy of HIV/AIDS education is transmitted in the classrooms in terms of classification and framing. In consideration of how students are educated about the disease, I explored students' grouping in terms of gender for getting knowledge and life skills to protect themselves from the pandemic. The theoretical resources for the analysis are drawn from Bernstein. The contribution of this thesis is two-fold. Firstly, it offers methodological techniques for evaluating of HIV/AIDS discourse with regard to how it is constructed and distributed in the classroom using a Bernsteinian framework. Secondly, the thesis points forward to further research in HIV/AIDS education for change in curriculum and pedagogic practices.","2005","2022-10-08 20:47:49","2022-10-08 20:47:49","2022-10-08 20:47:50","","","","","","","HIV/AIDS education in Butare-Ville secondary schools (Rwanda)","","","","","","","en","","Thesis","","","ukzn-dspace.ukzn.ac.za","","Accepted: 2010-11-26T10:36:47Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through an examination of several distinct literary and cultural fields, from the religious controversies of the Reformation embodied in the Protestant martyr of John Foxe's Actes and Monuments, to the suffering male body in the military dramas of Henry V and Coriolanus, to the histrionic suffering of Elizabethan petrarchism manifest in Sidney's Astrophil and Stella and Spenser's Amoretti, I assert that there emerges in early modernity a distinct form of the “individual” that is, unlike later post-Enlightenment forms of individualism, inextricably linked to parallel tropes of bodily suffering and male homoeroticism. The function of pain in the production of subjectivity has been central to the new historicist critique of humanist ideology, following Foucault's claim that in the early modern period dominant monarchical power was manifest through the spectacle of ritualized pain. This assertion has led critics to argue that the concept of the autonomous “individual,” which Foucault shows as emerging only in the eighteenth century, was not operative in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. I argue that the anti-humanist interpretation ignores the rhetoric of interiority that circulates in the Tudor and Stuart periods. While Foucaultian critics have seen the spectacle of the suffering body as producing and containing subjectivity through the violent assertion of monarchical authority, I contend that the suffering subject may be seen as appropriating the tropes of bodily pain to construct a peculiarly early modern form of interiorized subjectivity that resists such containment. I further contend that the physicality of the performance of suffering, with dramatic emphasis placed on the penetration of the body, invests suffering with an inescapable erotic inflection that allows the subject to be interpolated within the networks of homosocial desire that constitute patriarchal power relationships in early modern England. Thus the formulation of the suffering subject becomes vital to emergent forms of collective social order, particularly that of Elizabethan proto-nationalism.","","2022-10-08 20:54:50","2022-10-08 20:54:50","2022-10-08 20:54:50","","228","","","","","“Lives there who loves his pain?","","","","","The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","United States -- North Carolina","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780493446349","","","","","Communication and the arts; Edmund; Edmund Spenser; England; Foxe; John; John Foxe; Language; literature and linguistics; Shakespeare; Sidney; Sir Philip; Sir Philip Sidney; Spenser; Subjectivity; Suffering; William; William Shakespeare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to successfully address these challenges, each mining organisation needs to respond in a unified, aligned way.  This study strived to determine the degree of perceived organisational alignment among managers within South African based mining organisations and to uncover the key enablers of organisational alignment. Based on a literature review and extensive dialogue with relevant role-players within the South African mining industry, first, a multidimensional construct of perceived organisational alignment was conceived and second, within the context of perceived organisational alignment, enablers of organisational alignment were postulated. Measureable variables of the aforementioned were subsequently developed.  An online questionnaire-approach was followed to collect data from 286 managers from a selection of all the major South African mining commodity sectors on their perceptions of the degree of organisational alignment as well as on the enablers of organisational alignment. Using exploratory factor analysis, the validity and reliability of the proposed organisational alignment construct and organisational alignment enabling factors were examined.  Six factors explained the organisational alignment construct whereas the posited enablers of organisational alignment were explained by eleven factors. Spearman’s rank order correlation analysis followed and indicated statistically significant positive correlations between the eleven enabling factors and perceived organisational alignment.  Applying structural equation modelling, five of the eleven organisational alignment enabling factors indicated a unique influence of practical importance on perceived organisational alignment. Three data-model fit tests confirmed that the pattern of improve organisational alignment.  Taking a largely sociological perspective of organisational functioning within the South African mining industry’s fast-changing internal and external stakeholder environment, this study contributed to the discipline of strategy planning and execution in general and in particular to the subject area of organisational alignment.      variances and covariance in the data was consistent with the hypothesised framework of organisational alignment specified in this study.  The outcomes and practical value of this study were the following: a conceptual framework of organisational alignment; a validated and reliable measurement instrument of perceived organisational alignment and its enabling factors; and a range of recommendations on how South African mining organisations may improve organisational alignment.

By and large, modern scholarship on the CD has passed over the question of the pseudonym and the influence of Paul, preferring to interpret the corpus against the backdrop either of late Neoplatonism or late antique Eastern Christianity. Appreciating why this late fifth or early sixth century author wrote under the name of Paul's Athenian convert, mentioned in Acts 17:34, I argue, not only alters our understanding of many of the central themes of the CD but also resolves certain scholarly debates. Specifically, attention to the pseudonym and Paul allows us to made headway on such central, but controversial, themes as hierarchy, Christology, theurgy, and apophasis. This is the first contribution of this dissertation to the field. The second contribution has to do with theological anthropology. When we read the CD against the backdrop of the pseudonym and the influence of Paul, I contend, it becomes clear that the “mystical theology” of the CD has a corresponding “mystical anthropology,” to which Paul is the premier and authoritative witness. Paul is for Dionysius the exemplary lover of God, whose fervent eros carries him outside himself in ecstasy, and therefore renders him split and so open to the indwelling of Christ. Finally, I argue that the very practice of writing under a pseudonym, and especially this pseudonym, is for our author an ecstatic devotional practice that aims to breach the singular self—the “I”—and thereby to suffer, as Paul does, the indwelling of Christ: “it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me” (Gal 2:20). The third and final contribution of this dissertation, then, is my argument that the very writing of the CD, under a pseudonym, is a practice integral to the enterprise described in the CD, the mystical, theological and anthropological asceticism aiming to “unsay” and “unknow” God and self both.","2008","2022-10-09 02:28:43","2022-10-09 02:28:43","2022-10-09 02:28:43","","248","","","","","“No longer I”","","","","","Harvard Divinity School","United States -- Massachusetts","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Th.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780549827627 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","","","","","Apophasis; Apophatic anthropology; Apophatic theology; Dionysius the Areopagite; Paul the Apostle; Philosophy; Pseudepigraphia; Pseudo-Dionysius; Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite; Pseudonymity; religion and theology; Saint; Self","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"LX2UDY2V","thesis","","Greer, Mark Ralph","Expectations, uncertainty and the New Deal","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/303851515/abstract/145F383B4DFF4F94PQ/1","This dissertation examines whether the government's transcending the bounds of what businesspeople believe to be its legitimate role in the economy leads to uncertainty among businesspeople about the future course of government policy, and consequently reduces investment. A central premise of this thesis is that firms' perceptions of the coherence of government policy hinge, in part, on the extent to which policy conforms to businesspeoples' norms about legitimate government behavior. When the government breaks from businesspeoples' political norms, government policy appears rather incoherent and arbitrary to them. They consequently become uncertain about the future course government policy will take, and they cut back on investment spending. Such uncertainty has a depressing effect on investment because businesspeople have difficulty forming expectations of those future government policies that will influence the future profitability of present investments in fixed capital. Profit taxation and industrial regulation are obvious examples of policies influencing profitability that businesspeople must form expectations of. Uncertainty about future government policy leads to uncertainty about the future profitability of investing in fixed capital. When firms cannot form long-term expectations of profitability, investment in fixed capital assets becomes more risky. Therefore, the government faces a serious constraint on the policies it can undertake without inducing an investment slump: in so far as businesspeople view these policies as illegitimate, investment may stagnate. The business response to the New Deal is studied to determine whether this uncertainty-stagnation hypothesis sheds light on the failure of investment to recover during the New Deal. Much evidence indicates that businesspeople objected to the New Deal reforms because of the political values they held. There is also some evidence that the perceived arbitrariness of government policy arising from their normative objections to the New Deal led to uncertainty among them about future New Deal policies, as well as about profits.","","2022-10-09 02:38:14","2022-10-09 02:38:14","2022-10-09 02:38:14","","227","","","","","","","","","","University of Michigan","United States -- Michigan","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798207560472","","","","","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this huge investment, the current level of data use is limited and is raising concerns whether the growing amount of data adds value to users and offers meaningful return on data collection efforts. This study presents a holistic approach that can systematically integrate and bridge data with information and decisions through incorporation of a unique and proactive performance assessment technique to improve the utilization of a growing amount of data in transportation agencies. With a focus on enhancing the active utilization of data and measuring level of data use, this research delivers i) Integrated Data Quality Assessment Framework ii) Three-tiered Hierarchical Data-Information-Decision-making Framework and iii) Highway Infrastructure Data Integration (HIDI) index, new data and information performance assessment tool. The study presents an integrated requirement analysis to identify the satisfaction level of various highway decision-makers in current data use and determine the quality requirements of highway data in an integrated and objective manner through the application of fault tree analysis. A three-tiered hierarchical framework is presented to understand the relationship between data and information and identify their use in supporting highway infrastructure decision-making processes. As part of this framework, key players in decision-making processes are identified and quantified through the application of a social network theory. A new index called, HIDI is also developed to evaluate the status of data utilization that may serve as Highway Infrastructure Data Report Card and help justify the return on investment on the continuous and growing data collection efforts. This research study will allow agencies to interlink data, information and decisions and to develop active utilization plans of currently existing databases to place the right information in the hands of decision-makers. It will enhance the development of new data collection scheme and information generation plans to support key decisions that, historically, were not well-supported with information and data. The study uses pavement management data as a primary data set to illustrate the application of the framework and it also uses preconstruction service data as a case study and a validation data set. This new framework may be used as a benchmarking example for SHAs in the area of data and information integration to make effective and reliable decisions through data-driven insights.","","2022-10-09 02:39:48","2022-10-09 02:39:48","2022-10-09 02:39:48","","157","","","","","Highway infrastructure data and information integration & assessment framework","","","","","Iowa State University","United States -- Iowa","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781321270525","","","","","Applied sciences; Data integration; Decision-making; Highway infrastructure; Pavement condition data; Preconstruction service; Social sciences; Soical network analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"SQ4BSM7A","thesis","","Van Dyke, Ruth Marguerite","The Chaco connection: Bonito style architecture in outlier communities","","","","","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304412177/abstract/6DE5756D15D943C9PQ/1","During the A.D. tenth through the twelfth centuries, the Chaco Anasazi constructed at least 12 imposing sandstone masonry great houses in Chaco Canyon, in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico. Bonito style architecture, as defined in part by the canyon great houses, appears in nearly 100 Chacoan outlier communities throughout the greater San Juan Basin. This study employs architectural evidence in an attempt to clarify the nature and scope of the relationship between Chacoan outliers and the sites in Chaco Canyon and to increase understanding of outlier community sociopolitical organization. Bonito style architecture at outliers may have emanated from a central source at Chaco Canyon; the architecture could have been built by migrants from the canyon, by canyon masons, or by locals who went to the canyon to obtain the necessary information. By contrast, the architecture may have been constructed by local community leaders seeking to emulate or compete with neighboring communities. Internal architectural elements presumably could not be replicated by outsiders who lacked access to the information, so ""internal"" variables such as banded veneers and kiva/room ratio were compared across the outlier data base. If outlier Bonito style architecture had a central, Chaco Canyon source, internal variables were expected to exhibit similarity; if the architecture was constructed under local direction, internal variables were expected to exhibit diversity. The results of the analyses were mixed and suggest that substantial regional diversity is contained under the rubric of the Chacoan ""system."" Although some outliers may have interacted intensively with Chaco Canyon, others may have interacted rarely with the canyon or not at all. An examination of intra-community architectural variability was designed to assess whether network or corporate power strategies were more likely in outlier communities. Bonito style architecture would best lend itself to communal ritual endemic to many corporate situations. Stein and Lekson’s ""ritual landscape"" idea is the existing model with the most explanatory power given the existing data and results.
